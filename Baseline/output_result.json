  "prompt": "Document:\nNewton's second law states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration, expressed as F = ma. Here, F is the net force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration. This law explains the quantitative relationship between force and motion. For example, if friction is neglected, a 2 kg object acted on by a 3 N force will experience an acceleration of 1.5 m/s².\n\nUser Annotations:\n- F = ma: I know this formula, but I often get confused—what exactly causes acceleration? Is it just speeding up?\n- if friction is neglected: In exams, they often say to neglect friction. How do I know when it's okay to do that?\n- a 2 kg object acted on by a 3 N force will experience an acceleration of 1.5 m/s²: I like this kind of example with numbers—it makes it easier to understand.\n\nQuestion:\nHow do I know when it's okay to ignore friction in a problem? Also, does acceleration just mean speeding up?\n\nAnswer:",
  "response": "Whether you can ignore friction in a problem largely depends on the specific instructions in the question and the context. If a question states to neglect or ignore friction, then you can do so. Also, in basic physics problems, especially those dealing with motion in a vacuum or in space, or when you're in the early stages of learning physics, friction is often disregarded to simplify calculations.\n\nAcceleration does not only mean speeding up. It refers to any change in an object's velocity, which can be a change in speed or a change in direction. So, an object could be accelerating if it's speeding up, slowing down, or changing its direction of motion.",
