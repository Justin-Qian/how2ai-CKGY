Document:
Newton's second law states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration, expressed as F = ma. Here, F is the net force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration. This law explains the quantitative relationship between force and motion. For example, if friction is neglected, a 2 kg object acted on by a 3 N force will experience an acceleration of 1.5 m/sÂ².

Question:
In Newton's second law, does acceleration just mean speeding up?

Please answer this question considering what the user is interested in, confused about, and has known.

Response:
No, in Newton's second law, acceleration doesn't just mean speeding up. Acceleration, in terms of physics, refers to any change in the velocity of an object, which includes changes in speed, changes in direction, or both. So, an object can be accelerating if it is speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction. Application of force can cause any of these changes, considering the direction and amount of force applied relative to the object's mass.
