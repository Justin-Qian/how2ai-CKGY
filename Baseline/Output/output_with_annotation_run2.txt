Newton's second law states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration, expressed as F = ma. Here, F is the net force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration. This law explains the quantitative relationship between force and motion. For example, if friction is neglected, a 2 kg object acted on by a 3 N force will experience an acceleration of 1.5 m/s².

User Annotations:
- F = ma: I know this formula, but I often get confused—what exactly causes acceleration?
- if friction is neglected: In exams, they often say to neglect friction. How do I know when it's okay to do that?
- a 2 kg object acted on by a 3 N force will experience an acceleration of 1.5 m/s²: I like this kind of example with numbers—it makes it easier to understand.

Question:
In Newton's second law, does acceleration just mean speeding up?

Please answer this question considering what the user is interested in, confused about, and has known.

Response:
Acceleration in the context of Newton's second law doesn't just mean speeding up. It refers to any change in velocity—this could be speeding up (positive acceleration), slowing down (negative acceleration, or deceleration) or changing direction. What causes acceleration is the force acting on an object. For example, when you push harder on an object, it accelerates more. Hence the 'a' in the equation F=ma represents how fast the velocity of the object is changing under the influence of a given force. 

As for your question about when to neglect friction—it's typically appropriate to do this in the context of an introductory physics problems if the problem specifically says to, or if including friction would make the problem far more complex without significantly increasing understanding. In real world situations, however, friction often plays a significant role and can't be neglected. 

I'm glad you find numerical examples helpful! Remember, in the given example, a 2 kg object acted on by a 3 N force experiences an acceleration of 1.5 m/s² because according to F=ma, acceleration a = F/m, so a = 3N/2kg, which equals 1.5 m/s².
