Document:
Newton's second law states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration, expressed as F = ma. Here, F is the net force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration. This law explains the quantitative relationship between force and motion. For example, if friction is neglected, a 2 kg object acted on by a 3 N force will experience an acceleration of 1.5 m/sÂ².

Question:
In Newton's second law, does acceleration just mean speeding up?

Please answer this question considering what the user is interested in, confused about, and has known.

Response:
No, in Newton's second law, acceleration doesn't just mean speeding up. Acceleration refers to any change in an object's velocity, which includes speeding up (positive acceleration), slowing down (negative acceleration, or deceleration), and changing direction. Therefore, even if an object is moving at a constant speed but changing its direction, it is still considered to be accelerating according to physics.
