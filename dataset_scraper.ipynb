      "![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*0PffwEtZNrWuf1cPF6ySww.jpeg)\n",
      "전국적으로 대출사기 피해 사례가 꾸준히 증가하고 있습니다. 특히, 스마트폰과 모바일 금융 이용이 일상화되면서 사기범들은 문자 메시지를 통해 불특정 다수를 대상으로 한 접근을 시도하고 있습니다. 이 가운데 [불법 대출](https://ezloan.io/i/%EB%8C%80%EC%B6%9C%EC%82%AC%EA%B8%B0/)을 유인하는 문자 사기가 두드러지며, 단순한 정보 수집을 넘어 금전적 피해로 이어지는 사례가 많아지고 있습니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "한편, 피해자의 연령대도 특정 계층에 국한되지 않고 다양해지고 있습니다. 사회 초년생부터 은퇴를 앞둔 고령층까지 누구나 피해 대상이 될 수 있으며, 피해 금액 또한 수십만 원에서 수천만 원에 이르기까지 매우 폭넓게 나타나고 있습니다. 이러한 피해 확산은 금융 사기에 대한 경각심과 정보 보호의 중요성을 더욱 부각시키고 있습니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 대출사기 수법의 진화\n",
      "![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*DbDo1n39dZCk2oWR1cfaWA.jpeg)\n",
      "#### 불법 대출 문자를 통한 접근\n",
      "최근 대출사기 범죄자들은 불법 대출을 미끼로 한 문자 메시지를 무작위로 발송해 피해자를 유인하고 있습니다. 이들은 급전이 필요한 사람들의 심리를 노려, 간단한 정보 입력만으로 대출이 가능하다고 홍보합니다. 특히 정상적인 금융회사인 것처럼 꾸며져 있어 의심 없이 응답하는 경우가 많습니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 정부지원대출을 사칭한 문자 메시지 발송\n",
      "정부에서 지원하는 서민금융상품을 사칭한 대출 문자가 기승을 부리고 있습니다. 예를 들어, 저금리 정책자금, 소상공인 지원 대출 등으로 위장해 접근하며, [공공기관](https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B3%B5%EA%B3%B5%EA%B8%B0%EA%B4%80) 명칭이나 로고를 무단으로 사용해 신뢰를 유도합니다. 실제로는 존재하지 않는 대출상품이며, 모든 절차는 사기 목적입니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 실제 금융기관 로고 및 URL을 모방한 정교한 방식\n",
      "사기범들은 피해자의 경계를 허물기 위해 정교하게 위조된 금융기관 로고와 유사한 웹사이트 주소(URL)를 사용합니다. 공식 사이트와 매우 흡사한 화면 구성으로 이루어진 가짜 홈페이지에 접속을 유도해 개인정보를 탈취하거나 악성 앱 설치를 유도합니다. 사용자 입장에서는 진위를 구별하기 어려울 만큼 정밀하게 제작되어 있어 각별한 주의가 필요합니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 문자 사기를 통해 진행되는 주요 방식\n",
      "![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*2XltKcnXAlqLxxoUHsFF1g.jpeg)\n",
      "#### 링크 클릭 유도 후 악성 앱 설치 유도\n",
      "사기범은 실제 금융기관을 사칭한 문자 메시지를 보내 사용자가 포함된 링크를 클릭하도록 유도합니다. 해당 링크를 통해 악성 앱을 설치하게 되면, 피해자의 휴대폰 내 정보를 탈취하거나 원격 제어를 통해 금융 앱을 조작할 수 있습니다. 특히 피해자 모르게 인증번호를 가로채거나 금융 거래가 이뤄지는 경우도 있어 각별한 주의가 필요합니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 선입금 요구 및 보증금 명목의 금전 요구\n",
      "정식 대출 절차에서는 사전에 수수료나 보증금을 요구하지 않음에도 불구하고, 사기범은 이를 대출 승인 조건처럼 포장하여 금전을 요구합니다. 예를 들어 \"신용등급이 낮아 보증금이 필요하다\"는 식의 설명으로 피해자의 불안감을 자극하며 송금을 유도합니다. 한 번 입금을 하면 반복적으로 추가금을 요구하는 경우가 많아 더욱 주의해야 합니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 신분증 사진 및 통장 사본 요구\n",
      "사기범은 대출 심사를 위한 본인 확인 절차라고 속이며 신분증 사진이나 통장 사본을 요구합니다. 그러나 이러한 정보는 불법 대출, 명의도용, 대포통장 개설 등에 악용될 수 있으며, 피해자가 모르는 사이에 범죄에 연루되는 경우도 발생합니다. 금융기관이라면 반드시 정식 앱이나 홈페이지를 통해 서류를 받기 때문에 사적인 방식의 정보 요구는 거부해야 합니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 계좌 개설 후 대포통장으로 악용되는 사례\n",
      "피해자에게 특정 은행 계좌를 새로 개설하도록 한 뒤, 이를 범죄 조직이 대포통장으로 사용하는 사례가 빈번히 발생하고 있습니다. 사기범은 대출금 입금을 위한 절차라며 계좌 개설을 유도한 후, 해당 계좌를 타인의 불법 거래에 이용합니다. 이러한 경우 본인이 범죄에 연루된 사실조차 모르는 상황에서 금융사고가 발생할 수 있어 매우 위험합니다.\n",

      "![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*3PCClo3zlO00WG5kqvjUlg.jpeg)\n",
      "#### 정식 금융기관 여부 확인 방법\n",
      "대출을 제안하는 업체가 실제로 등록된 금융기관인지 확인하는 것이 가장 중요합니다. [금융감독원](https://www.fss.or.kr/fss/main/main.do?menuNo=200000)에서 운영하는 ‘금융소비자 정보포털 파인(FINE)’을 통해 정식 등록 여부를 조회할 수 있으며, 등록되지 않은 업체는 불법 사금융일 가능성이 높습니다. 전화번호나 사업자등록번호를 확인해도, 실제 기관과 동일하다고 방심해서는 안 됩니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 문자 내 URL 클릭 자제\n",
      "대출 안내 문자를 통해 URL을 전송받았다면 절대 바로 클릭하지 마시기 바랍니다. 스미싱 수법이 활용될 수 있으며, 클릭 시 악성 앱이 설치되거나 개인정보가 탈취될 수 있습니다. [한국인터넷진흥원](https://www.kisa.or.kr/)(KISA)에서는 이러한 문자 사기 피해를 줄이기 위한 신고 시스템과 예방 수칙을 제공하고 있으므로 참고하시기 바랍니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 대출 심사 명목으로 신분증, 통장 요구 시 즉시 의심\n",
      "신분증 사본, 통장 사본, 심지어 OTP 카드 사진을 요구하는 경우가 많습니다. 이는 대포통장 개설이나 신분 도용 등 2차 범죄로 이어질 수 있으므로 절대 제공해서는 안 됩니다. 금융회사는 정식 절차 없이 이런 정보를 요구하지 않으며, 의심되는 경우에는 바로 금융감독원이나 서민금융진흥원에 문의하는 것이 좋습니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 금융감독원 소비자 경보 확인 및 활용\n",
      "금융감독원은 대출사기와 관련된 경보를 주기적으로 발령하고 있으며, 소비자들이 쉽게 확인할 수 있도록 공식 홈페이지에 공지하고 있습니다. ‘소비자 경보’ 코너에서는 현재 유행 중인 사기 수법과 예방법이 구체적으로 안내되어 있으므로, 정기적으로 확인하는 것이 피해 예방에 효과적입니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 대출사기 경계의 필요성과 대응 방안\n",
      "![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*DbDo1n39dZCk2oWR1cfaWA.jpeg)\n",
      "대출사기를 당했다면 당황하지 말고 신속하게 금융감독원(1332), 경찰청 사이버수사대 또는 가까운 경찰서에 신고해야 합니다. 계좌이체를 했다면 즉시 해당 금융기관에 연락하여 지급정지를 요청하는 것이 중요합니다. 신고가 빠를수록 피해 복구 가능성이 높아지므로 망설이지 말고 행동에 옮기는 것이 필요합니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "대출사기의 수법은 점점 정교해지고 있어 개인의 경각심만으로는 한계가 있습니다. 정기적인 금융교육과 더불어 주변인과의 정보 공유가 중요합니다. 정부지원대출, 선입금 요구, 스미싱 문자 등 대표적인 수법을 미리 알고 있다면 피해를 예방하는 데 큰 도움이 됩니다. 특히 고령층이나 청소년을 대상으로 한 교육 확대가 필요합니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "불법 대출 문자의 차단은 개인뿐만 아니라 사회 전체의 노력이 필요합니다. 통신사와 금융기관의 협업을 통해 사기 문자를 실시간 차단하고, AI 기반 스팸 필터링 기술을 강화해야 합니다. 아울러, 수사기관과 금융당국 간의 공조도 필수적입니다. 사기문자 신고 활성화도 함께 이루어져야 합니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "대출이 필요할 경우, 사설 문자나 앱보다 금융당국에 등록된 정식 대출기관을 이용하는 것이 가장 안전합니다. [이지론](https://ezloan.io/)은 법적 기준을 충족한 합법 금융사로, 신속한 심사와 투명한 절차를 통해 안심하고 이용할 수 있습니다.\n",

Kingdon\\n\\u201cThe English Army (1380-1400)\\u201d British Library.\\nPicryl.com\\nA warrior known for his strength kills monsters and has a final epic battle with a dragon. A courageous woman who despises the oppression of her people, decides to take matters into her own hands, confronts the man responsible and in a single act of outrageous bravery sets her people free.\\u00a0 A nephew is sent abroad to accompany a beautiful young woman on a journey to marry his uncle. But on the way, the nephew and the young woman fall in love and the uncle finds out and plots revenge. In yet another story, a very young and loyal knight volunteers for a challenge that will send him away to a castle, where he has to fight off a knight that he cannot seem to kill and fight off the many advances of a married lady that he cannot seem to quell. A man meets a group of people at a tavern in South London\\u00a0 to go on a few days journey together. To pass the time, the group decides to tell stories and it is agreed that the person who has the most interesting story will get a free meal when they return to London.\\nAll of the above storylines could be contemporary. They might be found as plots in a Marvel comic, or in Japanese manga, or even in a Netflix movie. Yet, these stories are a thousand or more years old. One realises how even one thousand years ago, people still had very similar lives: they fought for justice, they fell in love (and sometimes not with the right person), they took on great challenges and had friends that they shared happy times with.\\u00a0 These stories make up our history and tug at our ancient memory. They are the stories of our past, present and future. What were the origins of these stories and how did our modern British Literature come to be?\\nIn order to fully understand where British Literature originated, one must go back to its beginnings. The British Isles, British Literature and most importantly, the\\nEnglish\\nlanguage has been shaped by many words, idioms and cultures brought by waves of migrations, wars and occupations over hundreds of years. It is a rich and varied history that cannot be traversed fully here, but there are thousands of books and online sources that can point you to more information on British History. For our purposes, we will focus on some basic points.\\nBritain in Earliest History\\nIt is known that about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, the British Isles were populated by hunter-gatherers from Europe. Farming in Britain began about 6,000 years ago where it\\u00a0 was settled by various tribal groups and clans. These were Neolithic tribes who are reported to have been the builders of the now iconic Stonehenge. At some point in history, around 2500 BCE, it is said that a culture called the \\u201cBeaker Culture\\u201d came in and settled with the existing inhabitants. They were called the \\u201cBeaker Culture\\u201d because of the beautiful lipped pottery that was found in its burial sites. The Beaker Culture is said to have come from the European continent and further east, from the Steppes in Eastern Europe. They seemed to have integrated into the Neolithic culture as archaeological information shows that beakers have been found in many Neolithic henges in Britain. Some believe that they assisted with the building of Stonehenge and Avebury, the great prehistoric stone circles in southwest\\nEngland\\n. The Beaker Culture gave way to what is now known as the \\u201cWessex Culture\\u201d. The Wessex Culture\\u00a0 produced the most beautiful prehistoric artefacts. Many of them are crafted of gold and amber which has led experts to believe that there was a healthy trade between this culture and the Greeks.\\nFrom 2500 BCE to 500 BCE, more Celtic settlers came from the European Continent. They still all belonged to different groups and they began to fall into more distinct tribes or clans: the Britons (who inhabited the middle and south of the island), the Gaels (who settled in parts of Ireland) and the Picts (who were in the north of the Island which is now Scotland). These were very distinct tribes, but they were united in a somewhat common pagan religion and a similar language and culture.\\nThe Arrival of the Romans\\nThe conquest of Britain by the Romans was of paramount importance historically. This was accomplished over many years, but began with Emperor Claudius installing his own governor in 43 CE. Most significantly was the invasion of Britain by Augustus Caesar. Around 53 CE Caesar attempted his first invasion of the British Isles by coming in from the southeast or what is now known as Thanet in the province of Kent. The Romans knew that the island had massive reserves of tin and were very interested in the possible mineral and economic reserves the area might produce for the empire.\\u00a0 That first invasion failed. The Romans retreated and planned another invasion for 54 CE, a year later. In the summer of 54 CE the Romans mounted another invasion, using 25,000 troops, 2,000 cavalry, 600 transports and 28 warships.\\u00a0 This time, the Romans were successful. One of the most interesting historical battles to come out of this Roman occupation was that of Boudica, the Queen of the Iceni tribe. Her husband, who was an ally of Rome, had left his lands jointly to his daughters and to the Roman Emperor in his will. The will was ignored and the lands were seized. Boudica was flogged and her daughters raped.\\u00a0 In 60 CE,\\u00a0 Boudica led the Iceni, the Trinovantes and other renegade groups in a revolt. They managed to kill 70,000 to 80,000 Romans while destroying present-day London in its wake. In the end, Boudica was defeated and died soon after. She is now considered a folk hero in Great Britain. And while the invasion of Britain was to continue until 84 CE, it was the 54 CE campaign of Augustus Caesar that began to fully secure Britain or \\u201cBrittania\\u201d as a Roman territory. The Romans conquered the most of Britain, but could never make inroads north into the Pictish territory, which is now Scotland.\\u00a0 The Britons adapted themselves to Roman rule for five hundred years.\\u00a0 The Romans brought their customs, their language, their laws and their building skills. These skills can still be seen today in the many Roman ruins still found in Britain and the network of\\u00a0 roads that they left behind. The famous Hadrian\\u2019s Wall that stretches across the island even to this day,\\u00a0 is still a testament to the engineering feat of the Romans.\\nRome and Emperor Constantine\\nDuring the Roman occupation of Britain, there was an important historical event that took place. This monumental decision changed the course of the dissemination of the written word that was to come in Britain. The Emperor Constantine who reigned from 306-337 CE, adopted Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire. This was significant as it led to Christianity being introduced to Britain. While there were some conversions at that time, most still held to their pagan religions. Centuries later, a system of education and writing would be introduced through the Christian monasteries which would lead to the establishment and preservation of the early literature and language of Britain.\\nThe End of the Roman Rule\\nThe Romans ruled over Britain until approximately 410 CE. By that time, the Roman empire was on the wane and losing power. Rome called back all of its available troops, from Britain to defend Rome against the incoming enemy. In 410 BCE, the Visigoths were let into the city of Rome by rebels and for three days they sacked and plundered the city leaving it a smoking ruin. Rome fell to the \\u201cbarbarians\\u201d and the fall of the Roman empire was sealed. Britain was left to fend for itself and without a warrior class or\\u00a0 strong army, it was also in a vulnerable position militarily. This made it perfect again for conquest.\\nThe Germanic Tribal Settlement of Britain\\nAfter the Romans left Britain, there was a great seafaring migration of Germanic tribes that took place beginning in 450 CE.\\u00a0 The primary migrants were the Jutes, Angles and Saxons. It is from these tribes that the\\nEnglish\\nlanguage began to take shape. For example, the very word\\nEnglish\\ncomes from the word\\nAngles.\\nWhile the Venerable Bede called it an \\u201cinvasion\\u201d,\\u00a0 current research has concluded that no military campaigns were ever fully mounted. It was simply a movement of Germanic groups settling in the British lands. This was also not a swift migration. It took decades. The Britons fought the incursions as they could but they were not successful. Eventually the Britons moved westward into what is now Wales where one can still hear the modern version of their original language still spoken today. While it was not an \\u201cinvasion\\u201d, there was a gradual takeover of the lands that had been once occupied by the Romans in the areas that did not have enough Britons to mount a resistance.\\nChristianity after the Romans\\nAs noted before, during the last century of the Roman occupation, many Britons had converted to Christianity under the rule of Emperor Constantine. But after the exit of the Romans, Christianity was on the wane as the pagan religions under the Anglo-Saxons took precedence again. For the first 150 years of the Germanic settlements, the Christian religion was only practiced in the\\u00a0 areas where the Anglo-Saxons would not or could not venture. These were the mountainous regions or the regions filled with deep forests. Christianity was, in a sense, forced underground. But a hundred and fifty years later, that would change dramatically.\\nPope Gregory and St Augustine\\nPope Gregory (who was pope of the Catholic Church from 590 to 604 CE) was instrumental in bringing Christianity to Britain. It is said that one day while walking through the slave market in Rome, he spotted two young pale Britons. He asked where these boys were from. The response was that they were \\u201cAngles\\u201d. To which, it is said that Gregory responded: \\u201cnon angli, sed angeli\\u201d or \\u201cnot Angles, but angels\\u201d. This\\u00a0 legendary encounter in the market\\u00a0 prompted Pope Gregory to dispatch Augustine, one of his most favoured and erudite monks (later to be St Augustine of Canterbury)\\u00a0 to Britain to begin the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons in 597.\\u00a0 Augustine went as a missionary to King Ethelbert of Kent who lived in the Southern area of Britain, while Irish missionaries continued their work for the Church in the North. Within 75 years, Britain had become fully Christian.\\nThe Impact of Christianity on Literacy\\nIt may seem extraneous to spend so much time discussing Christianity in a course of Early Medieval Literature. But it is because of Christianity that the oral tradition began to be set down in books. These illuminated manuscripts were painstakingly copied by hand by the monks who inhabited the many monasteries that began to spring up all over Britain. In this way, knowledge began to spread all over Britain as the libraries in these monasteries grew to be repositories of history and literature.\\nCharlemagne and Alcuin\\nAlcuin (born in 730) was a young child when he went to study under Archbishop Egbert.\\u00a0 He became Master of the York school in 778 and a deacon in the church though he never was ordained as a priest. He wrote educational books and hundreds of letters many of which are still extant. On his way back from a visit to Rome, he had an encounter that would change his life: he met Charlemagne (or Charles the First) who was so impressed with his knowledge that he asked him to join his court. Alcuin was made the head of the palace school in the court of Charlemagne where he established a great library. Eventually this palace school became Northwest Europe\\u2019s first university. Alcuin\\u2019s contributions fostered an intellectual movement which eventually swept to the monasteries and cathedrals all across Europe and Britain. Despite the fact that he ended up spending a great deal of his life on the continent, his writings at York and his educational contributions left a great insight into medieval Britain for posterity.\\nThe (Berserk) Vikings\\nThis long era of the building of libraries, universities and monasteries to house information and disseminate education lasted for only a few more years.\\u00a0 Around 790 CE, the Vikings from Scandinavia (or the \\u201cNorsemen\\u201d becoming the word Norman in later years) began sailing and raiding countries in Northern Europe, Russia, the Mediterranean and on into Britain and France. They were ruthless warriors and were interested in only one thing:\\ntreasure\\n. These Norsemen had no mercy and their ferocious bands killed and destroyed without a thought. The word \\u201cbeserk\\u201d comes from these Norsemen whose behaviour was without remorse. They were called this as they wore nothing but bearskin or \\u201cberserkar\\u201das battle raiment.\\u00a0 The greatest losses during this time occurred in Northumbria, the most important centre of learning\\u00a0 in Britain at that time. The Vikings destroyed the illustrious library at Lindisfarne and with it hundreds of illuminated books and manuscripts.\\u00a0 The reports stated that the plunderers trampled on the bodies of the monks and poured their blood out on the altars. Any monks that survived were taken into slavery. A similar fate came to the monastery at St Columba, on the island of Iona off the coast of Scotland in 806 CE. The monastery was 200 years old and was the premier church of Celtic Christianity. Most importantly, it was the burial place of Scottish kings. It was sacked and pillaged and left in total ruin. The site was abandoned for hundreds of years until it was re-established in the 1400\\u2019s.\\u00a0 The Viking raids destroyed much of the written chronicles and manuscripts which were being housed in monasteries dotted across Britain. Latin and learning went into decline as these raids became a regular occurrence.\\nThe Arrival of the Danes\\nIn 865 CE, a huge army of \\u201cheathens\\u201d landed in East Anglia. They were the Danes from Denmark, another Scandinavian country intent on gaining new lands. They were conquerors and they basically began to move in and occupy parts of Britain. The Danes took East Anglia and proceeded to Mercia (the Midlands) and took it as well. But the Danes were bent on seizing all of Britain, so they continued attempted incursions into other areas. It was only when they got to Wessex that they began to meet resistance. For in Wessex, they encountered Alfred.\\nKing Alfred the Great who Burnt the Cakes\\nIf anyone was to have been thought of as \\u201cleast likely to be king\\u201d it would have been Alfred. He was the youngest son of King Aethelwulf of Wessex. He had three older brothers in the line of succession before him, all who reigned before him and all who died. Alfred became King of Wessex in 871 CE after the death of Aethelred, his brother. Alfred had spent years fighting against the Danish invasions alongside his older brother. He had been a very brilliant and precocious child who enjoyed studying and reading. After years of fighting, \\u00a0 \\u00a0 King Alfred was finally able to broker the first treaty with the Danes but that peace lasted only one year as the Danes quickly captured Wareham and Exeter in 877 .\\u00a0 At that point, Alfred laid siege and the Danes were forced to retreat to the North. In 878, the warrior chief Guthrum and the Danes marched against Alfred again while he was wintering in Chippenham in what is now Wiltshire province. Guthrum descended from the north and directed another of his armies to move north from the south in an attempt to pin Alfred from both directions. However, the Danish moving northward decided to capture a small fortress held by a Wessex alderman named Odda. It turned out to be a very ill-conceived strategic move. Odda and his Saxon men attacked the Danes in their sleep and managed to save Alfred from the encroaching northbound Danish warriors. Despite that, Alfred and his men were no match for the Danish. For the rest of the winter and spring of 878, Alfred was forced to go into hiding.\\nThe folk legend says that it was a Saxon\\u00a0 farm family who took him in, not knowing who he was. One day, the farmer\\u2019s wife asked him to please watch the cakes she was baking while she went out. Alfred, lost in contemplation over his next move against the Danes, forgot all about the cakes and received a verbal thrashing from the farmer\\u2019s wife when she found that they had all burnt. Still Alfred never told her who he was. He simply took the tongue-lashing and apologised for his negligence. It is said that this was a testament to the humility of the King and his sterling character which in later years came to be proven true as he emerged as an extraordinary and fair ruler. In the spring (after the cake debacle), Alfred gathered up his army once again and attacked Guthrum in Edington, Wiltshire. The Danes retreated to Chippenham pursued by Alfred and his army who laid siege to Guthrum and his men. Guthrum could not hold out and surrendered. King Alfred laid out his terms of surrender: one of which was that Guthrum would agree to be baptized a Christian with Alfred as his godfather. Guthrum accepted. And though Guthrum retreated north after that and attempted to attack Kent in 884 CE, he was defeated. It was at that time that the \\u201cTreaty of Alfred and Guthrum\\u201d was drawn up which established the boundaries of \\u201cDanelaw\\u201d and allowed for Danish self-rule in that region ( the northeastern region of present-day\\nEngland\\n).\\nKing Alfred would prove to be a very effective and intelligent ruler. It is said that he was one of the most learned and educated kings in British history. He was a gifted strategist as well. He built fortresses all around Britain with ramparts that would help to stave off any further attacks by the Danes. He also constructed a strong navy with the same longships as the Danes and then, very cleverly, hired Danish mercenaries to man them. With this navy, he was actually able to win victories over the savage Viking raiders including the defeat of 250 naval ships that were found off the coast of Kent in 892 CE. (These Vikings were not from Scandinavia, they were coming from France, where the French king was about to grant them land in the North later to be known as \\u201cNormandy\\u201d).\\nAlfred established his capital to Winchester, Hampshire. Here, when he had time to settle,\\u00a0 he began to bemoan the fact that after the destruction of the monasteries, in all of his kingdom, he could not find one clerk who could speak Latin. Alfred then began to invite scholars from the European continent and took half of his royal revenues to give to church schools so that his people could once again be literate and that his court could rival the great courts of Europe. He oversaw the translation of texts into Anglo-Saxon including his own work about Boethius. In 890 CE, he commissioned the\\nAnglo-Saxon Chronicles\\nwhich became the basis of all knowledge after the time of Bede. He was instrumental in the propagation of learning and literature in his time. Alfred was the first monarch to come up with a legal code that made kings subject to the law. He cared for the future of the country, of his people and for the preservation of the history and learning of his land. He was known as a just ruler and was the first to call himself \\u201cKing of the Anglo-Saxons,\\u201d and he was also the first to use the word \\u201c\\nEngland\\n\\u201d for his kingdom. King Alfred was lauded for all his contributions to society in the areas of justice and education. His bravery against the Vikings and\\u00a0 Danish was unparalleled. In the 16th century he was named \\u201cKing Alfred the Great\\u201d by writers and historians of the time. He still is, to this day, the only British monarch to have been granted the title \\u201c the Great\\u201d.\\nIt was out of this historical melting pot of Celtic origins with Germanic influences, Scandinavian invasions and ancient Roman culture that British literature and language was formed. And, in 1066, the Anglo-Saxon culture was to undergo the greatest change of all.\\nPrevious/next navigation\\nPrevious: Accessibility Statement\\nNext: Gildas: From The Ruin of Britain\\nBack to top\\nLicense\\nAn Open Companion to Early British Literature\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2019 by\\nAllegra Villarreal\\nis licensed under a\\nCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License\\n, except where otherwise noted.\\nShare This Book\\nShare on X\\nShare on LinkedIn\\nShare via Email\\nPowered by\\nPressbooks\\nGuides and Tutorials\\n|\\nPressbooks Directory\\n|\\nContact\\nPressbooks on YouTube\\nPressbooks on LinkedIn\",\n",

They will be updated throughout the Fall 2024 semester.\\nPrevious Chapter\\nTable of contents\\nNext Chapter\\nMotion Planning\\nThere are a few more essential skills that we need in our toolbox.  In this\\nchapter, we will explore some of the powerful methods of kinematic trajectory\\nmotion planning.\\nI'm actually almost proud of making it this far into the notes without\\ncovering this topic yet.  Writing a relatively simple script for the pose of\\nthe gripper, like we did in the bin picking chapter, really can solve a lot of\\ninteresting problems.  But there are a number of reasons that we might want a\\nmore automated solution:\\nWhen the environment becomes more cluttered, it is harder to write\\nsuch a simple solution, and we might have to worry about collisions between\\nthe arm and the environment as well as the gripper and the environment.\\nIf we are doing \\\"mobile manipulation\\\" -- our robotic arms are attached to\\na mobile base -- then the robot might have to operate in many different environments.  Even if the workspace is not geometrically complicated,\\nit might still be different enough each time we reach that it requires\\nautomated (but possibly still simple) planning.\\nIf the robot is\\noperating in a simple known environment all day long, then it probably makes\\nsense to optimize the trajectories that it is executing; we can often speed up\\nthe manipulation process significantly.\\nIn fact, if you ran the\\nclutter\\nclearing demo\\n, I would say that motion planning failures were the biggest\\nlimitation of that solution so far: the hand or objects could sometimes\\ncollide with the cameras or bins, or the differential-inverse kinematics\\nstrategy (which effectively ignored the joint angles) would sometime cause the\\nrobot to fold in on itself. In this chapter we'll develop the tools to\\nmake that much better!\\nI do need to make one important caveat. For motion planning in\\nmanipulation, lots of emphasis is placed on the problem of avoiding\\ncollisions. Despite having done some work in this field myself, I actually\\nreally dislike the problem formulation of collision-free motion planning.  I\\nthink that on the whole, robots are too afraid of bumping into the world\\n(because things still go wrong when they do). I don't think humans are\\nsolving these complex geometric problems every time we reach... even when we\\nare reaching in dense clutter. I actually suspect that we are very bad at\\nsolving them. I would much rather see robots that perform well even with very\\ncoarse / approximate plans for moving through a cluttered environment, that\\nare not afraid to make incidental contacts, and that can still accomplish the\\ntask when they do!\\nInverse Kinematics\\nThe goal of this chapter is to solve for motion trajectories.  But I would argue that if you really understand how to solve inverse kinematics, then you've got most of what you need to plan trajectories.\\nWe know that the\\nforward kinematics\\ngive us a (nonlinear) mapping from joint angles to e.g. the pose of the\\ngripper: $X^G = f_{kin}(q)$.  So, naturally, one would think that the\\nproblem of inverse kinematics (IK) is about solving for the inverse map, $q\\n= f^{-1}_{kin}(X^G).$  But, like we did with differential inverse\\nkinematics, I'd like to think about inverse kinematics as the more general\\nproblem of finding joint angles subject to a rich library of costs and\\nconstraints; and the space of possible kinematic constraints is indeed\\nrich.\\nFor example, when we were\\nevaluating grasp candidates for bin\\npicking\\n, we had only a soft preference on the orientation of the hand\\nrelative to some antipodal grasp.  In that case, specifying 6 DOF pose of\\nthe gripper and finding one set of joint angles which satisfies it exactly\\nwould have been an overly constrained specification.  I would say that it's\\nrare that we have only end-effector pose constraints to reason about, we\\nalmost always have costs or constraints in joint space (like joint limits)\\nand others in Cartesian space (like non-penetration constraints).\\nClick here to watch the video.\\nWe made extensive use of rich inverse kinematics\\nspecifications in our work on humanoid robots.  The video above is an\\nexample of the interactive inverse kinematics interface (here to help us\\nfigure out how to fit the our big humanoid robot into the little Polaris).\\nHere is another\\nvideo\\nof the same tool being used for the Valkyrie humanoid, where we\\ndo specify and end-effector pose, but we also add a joint-centering\\nobjective and static stability constraints\\nFallon14+Marion16\\n.\\nFrom end-effector pose to joint angles\\nWith its obvious importance in robotics, you probably won't be\\nsurprised to hear that there is an extensive literature on inverse\\nkinematics.  But you may be surprised at how extensive and complete the\\nsolutions can get. The forward kinematics, $f_{kin}$, is a nonlinear\\nfunction in general, but it is a very structured one.  In fact, with rare\\nexceptions (like if your robot has a\\nhelical\\njoint\\n, aka screw joint), the equations governing the valid Cartesian\\npositions of our robots are actually\\npolynomial\\n.  \\\"But wait!  What\\nabout all of those sines and cosines in my kinematic equations?\\\" you say.\\nThe trigonometric terms come when we want to relate joint angles with\\nCartesian coordinates.  In $\\\\Re^3$, for two points, $A$ and $B$, on the\\nsame rigid body, the (squared) distance between them, $\\\\|p^A - p^B\\\\|^2,$\\nis a constant.  And a joint is just a polynomial constraint between\\npositions on adjoining bodies, e.g. that they occupy the same point in\\nCartesian space.  See\\nWampler11\\nfor an excellent\\noverview.\\nexample: trig and polynomial kinematics of a two-link arm.\\nUnderstanding the solutions to polynomial equations is the subject of\\nalgebraic geometry.  There is a deep literature on kinematics theory, on\\nsymbolic algorithms, and on numerical algorithms.  For even very complex\\nkinematic topologies, such as\\nfour-bar\\nlinkages\\nand\\nStewart-Gough\\nplatforms\\n, we can count the number of solutions, and/or understand\\nthe continuous manifold of solutions.  For instance,\\nWampler11\\ndescribes a substantial toolbox for numerical algebraic geometry (based on\\nhomotopy methods) with impressive results on difficult kinematics\\nproblems.\\nThe kinematics algorithms based on algebraic geometry have\\ntraditionally been targeted for offline global analysis, and are often\\nnot designed for fast real-time inverse kinematics solutions needed in a\\ncontrol loop.  The most popular tool these days for real-time inverse\\nkinematics for six- or seven-DOF manipulators is a tool called \\\"IKFast\\\",\\ndescribed in Section 4.1 of\\nDiankov10\\n, that gained\\npopularity because of its effective open-source implementation.  Rather\\nthan focus on completeness, IKFast uses a number of approximations to\\nprovide fast and numerically robust solutions to the \\\"easy\\\" kinematics\\nproblems.  It leverages the fact that a six-DOF pose constraint on a\\nsix-DOF manipulator has a \\\"closed-form\\\" solution (for most serial-chain\\nrobot arms) with a finite number of joint space configurations that\\nproduce the same end-effector pose, and for seven-DOF manipulators it\\nadds a layer of sampling in the last degree of freedom on top of the\\nsix-DOF solver.\\nadd an example of calling (or implementing something equivalent to)\\nIKFast and/or Bertini. looks like bertini 2 has python bindings (but not\\npip) and is GPL3.\\nThese explicit solutions are important to understand because they\\nprovide deep insight into the equations, and because they can be fast\\nenough to use inside a more sophisticated solution approach.  But the\\nsolutions don't immediately provide the rich specification I advocated\\nfor above; in particular, they break down once we have inequality\\nconstraints instead of equality constraints.  For those richer\\nspecifications, we will turn to optimization.\\nIK as constrained optimization\\nRather than formulate inverse kinematics as $$q = f^{-1}_{kin}(X^G),$$\\nlet's consider solving the same problem as an optimization: \\\\begin{align}\\n\\\\min_q & \\\\quad |q - q_0|^2, \\\\\\\\ \\\\subjto &\\\\quad X^G = f_{kin}(q),\\n\\\\end{align} where $q_0$ is some comfortable nominal position. While\\nwriting the inverse directly is a bit problematic, especially because we\\nsometimes have multiple (even infinite) solutions or no solutions. This\\noptimization formulation is slightly more precise -- if we have multiple\\njoint angles which achieve the same end-effector position, then we prefer\\nthe one that is closest to the nominal joint positions. But the real\\nvalue of switching to the optimization perspective of the problem is that\\nit allows us to connect to a rich library of additional costs and\\nconstraints.\\nA\\nricher inverse kinematics problem: solve for the joint angles, $q$, that\\nallow the robot to reach into the shelf and grab the object, while\\navoiding collisions.\\nWe have\\nalready\\ndiscussed\\nthe idea of solving\\ndifferential\\ninverse kinematics\\nas an optimization problem.  In that workflow, we started by using the\\npseudo-inverse of the kinematic Jacobian, but then graduated to thinking\\nabout the least-squares formulation of the inverse problem.  The more\\ngeneral least-squares setting, we could add additional costs and\\nconstraints that would protect us from (nearly) singular Jacobians and\\ncould take into account additional constraints from joint limits, joint\\nvelocity limits, etc.  We could even add collision avoidance constraints.\\nSome of these constraints are quite nonlinear / nonconvex functions of\\nthe configuration $q$, but in the differential kinematics setting we were\\nonly seeking to find a small change $\\\\Delta q$ around the nominal\\nconfiguration, so it was quite reasonable to make linear/convex\\napproximations of these nonlinear/nonconvex constraints.\\nNow we will consider the full formulation, where we try to solve the\\nnonlinear / nonconvex optimization directly, without any constraints on\\nonly making a small change to an initial $q$.  This is a much harder\\nproblem computationally.  Using powerful nonlinear optimization solvers\\nlike SNOPT, we are often able to solve the problems, even at interactive\\nrates (the example below is quite fun).  But there are no guarantees.  It\\ncould be that a solution exists even if the solver returns\\n\\\"infeasible\\\".\\nOf course, the differential IK problem and the full IK problem are\\nclosely related.  In fact, you can think about the differential IK\\nalgorithm as doing one step of (projected) gradient descent or  one-step\\nof\\nSequential Quadratic Programming\\n,\\nfor the full nonlinear problem.\\nDrake provides a nice\\nInverseKinematics\\nclass that makes it easy to assemble many of the standard\\nkinematic/multibody constraints into a\\nMathematicalProgram\\n.  Take a minute to look at the\\nconstraints that are offered.  You can add constraints on the relative\\nposition and/or orientation on two bodies, or that two bodies are more\\nthan some minimal distance apart (e.g. for non-penetration) or closer\\nthan some distance, and more.  This is the way that I want you to think\\nabout the IK problem; it is an inverse problem, but one with a\\npotentially very rich set of costs and constraints.\\nInteractive IK\\nDespite the nonconvexity of the problem and nontrivial computational\\ncost of evaluating the constraints, we can often solve it at\\ninteractive rates.  I've assembled a few examples of this in the\\nchapter notebook:\\nIn the first version, I've added sliders to let you control the\\ndesired pose of the end-effector.  This is the simple version of the IK\\nproblem, amenable to more explicit solutions, but we nevertheless solve\\nit with our full nonlinear optimization IK engine (and it does include\\njoint limit constraints).  This demo won't look too different from the\\nvery first example in the notes, where you used teleop to command the\\nrobot to pick up the red brick.  In fact, differential IK offers a fine\\nsolution to this problem, too.\\nIn the second example, I've tried to highlight the differences\\nbetween the nonlinear IK problem and the differential IK problem by\\nadding an obstacle directly in front of the robot.  Because both our\\ndifferential IK and IK formulations are able to consume the\\ncollision-avoidance constraints, both solutions will try to prevent you\\nfrom crashing the arm into the post.  But if you move the target\\nend-effector position from one side of the post to the other, the full\\nIK solver can switch over to a new solution with the arm on the other\\nside of the post, but the differential IK will never be able to make\\nthat leap (it will stay on the first side of the post, refusing to\\nallow a collision).\\nAs the desired end-effector position moves along\\npositive $y$, the IK solver is able to find a new solution with the\\narm wrapped the other way around the post.\\nWith great power comes great responsibility.  The inverse kinematics\\ntoolbox allows you to formulate complex optimizations, but your success\\nwith solving them will depend partially on how thoughtful you are about\\nchoosing your costs and constraints.  My basic advice is this:\\nTry to keep the objective (costs) simple; I typically only use the\\n\\\"joint-centering\\\" quadratic cost on $q$.  Putting terms that should be\\nconstraints into the cost as penalties leads to lots of cost-function\\ntuning, which can be a nasty business.\\nWrite minimal constraints.\\nYou want the set of feasible configurations to be as big as possible.\\nFor instance, if you don't need to fully constrain the orientation of the\\ngripper, then don't do it.\\nI'll follow-up with that second\\npoint using the following example.\\nGrasp the cylinder\\nLet's use IK to grasp a cylinder. You can think of it as a hand\\nrail, if you prefer.  Suppose it doesn't matter where along the\\ncylinder we grasp, nor the orientation at which we grasp it.  Then we\\nshould write the IK problem using only the minimal version of those\\nconstraints.\\nIn the notebook, I've coded up one version of this.  I've put the\\ncylinder's pose on the sliders now, so you can move it around the\\nworkspace, and watch how the IK solver decides to position the robot.\\nIn particular, if you move the cylinder in $\\\\pm y$, you'll see that the\\nrobot doesn't try to follow... until the hand gets to the end of the\\ncylinder. Very nice!\\nOne could imagine multiple ways to implement that constraint.\\nHere's how I did it:\\nik.AddPositionConstraint(\\nframeB=gripper_frame, p_BQ=[0, 0.1, -0.02],\\nframeA=cylinder_frame, p_AQ_lower=[0, 0, -0.5], p_AQ_upper=[0, 0, 0.5])\\nik.AddPositionConstraint(\\nframeB=gripper_frame, p_BQ=[0, 0.1, 0.02],\\nframeA=cylinder_frame, p_AQ_lower=[0, 0, -0.5], p_AQ_upper=[0, 0, 0.5])\\nIn words, I've defined two points in the gripper frame; in the notation\\nof the\\nAddPositionConstraint\\nmethod they are ${}^Bp^{Q}$.\\nRecall the\\ngripper frame\\nis such\\nthat $[0, .1, 0]$ is right between the two gripper pads; you should\\ntake a moment to make sure you understand where $[0,.1,-0.02]$ and\\n$[0,.1,0.02]$ are.  Our constraints require that both of those points\\nshould lie exactly on the center line segment of the cylinder.  This\\nwas a compact way for me to leave the orientation around the cylinder\\naxis as unconstrained, and capture the cylinder position constraints\\nall quite nicely.\\nWe've provided a rich language of constraints for specifying IK\\nproblems, including many which involve the kinematics of the robot and\\nthe geometry of the robot and the world (e.g., the minimum-distance\\nconstraints).  Let's take a moment to appreciate the geometric puzzle\\nthat we are asking the optimizer to solve.\\nVisualizing the configuration space\\nLet's return to the example of the iiwa reaching into the shelf.\\nThis IK problem has two major constraints: 1) we want the center of the\\ntarget sphere to be in the center of the gripper, and 2) we want the\\narm to avoid collisions with the shelves.  In order to plot these\\nconstraints, I've frozen three of the joints on the iiwa, leaving only\\nthe three corresponding motion in the $x-z$ plane.\\nThe image on the right is a visualization of the \\\"grasp\\nthe sphere\\\" constraint in configuration space -- the x,y,z, axes in\\nthe visualizer correspond to the three joint angles of the\\nplanarized iiwa.\\nTo visualize the constraints, I've sampled a dense grid in the three\\njoint angles of the planarized iiwa, assigning each grid element to 1\\nif the constraint is satisfied or 0 otherwise, then run a marching\\ncubes algorithm to extract an approximation of the true 3D geometry of\\nthis constraint in the configuration space.  The \\\"grasp the sphere\\\"\\nconstraint produces the nice green geometry I've pictured above on the\\nright; it is clipped by the joint limits.  The collision-avoidance\\nconstraint, on the other hand, is quite a bit more complicated.  To see\\nthat, you'd better open up this\\n3D\\nvisualization\\nso you can navigate around it yourself.  Scary!\\nVisualizing the IK optimization problem\\nTo help you appreciate the problem that we've formulated, I've made\\na visualization of the optimization landscape. Take a look at the\\nlandscape\\nhere\\nfirst; this\\nis only plotting a small region around the returned solution. You can\\nuse the Meshcat controls to show/hide each of the individual costs and\\nconstraints, to make sure you understand.\\nAs recommended, I've kept the cost landscape (the\\ngreen\\nsurface) to be simply the quadratic joint-centering cost. The\\nconstraints are plotted in\\nblue\\nwhen they are feasible, and\\nred\\nwhen they are infeasible:\\nThe joint limit constraint is just a simple \\\"bounding-box\\\"\\nconstraint here (only the red infeasible region is drawn for bounding\\nbox constraints, to avoid making the visualization too\\ncluttered).\\nThe position constraint has three elements: for the $x$, $y$, and\\n$z$ positions of the end-effector. The $y$ position constraint is\\ntrivially satisfied (all blue) because the manipulator only has the\\njoints that move in the $x-z$ plane. The other two look all red, but\\nif you turn off the $y$ visualization, you can see two small strips\\nof blue in each. That's the conditions in our tight position\\nconstraint.\\nBut it's the \\\"minimum-distance\\\" (non-collision) constraint that is the most impressive / scary of all. While we visualized the configuration space above, you can see here that visualizing the distance as a real-valued function reveals the optimization landscape that we give to the solver.\\nThe intersection of all the blue regions here are what defined\\nthe configuration-space in the example above. All of the code for this\\nvisualization is available in the notebook, and you can find the exact\\nformulation of the costs and constraints there:\\nYou should also take a quick look at the\\nfull optimization landscape\\n.  This\\nis the same set of curves as in the visualization above, but now it's\\nplotted over the entire domain of joint angles within the joint limits.\\nNonlinear optimizers like SNOPT can be pretty amazing sometimes!\\nGlobal inverse kinematics\\nFor unconstrained inverse kinematics with exactly six degrees of\\nfreedom, we have closed-form solutions. For the generalized inverse\\nkinematics problem with rich costs and constraints, we've got a nonlinear\\noptimization problem that works well in practice but is subject to local\\nminima (and therefore can fail to find a feasible solution if it exists).\\nIf we give up on solving the optimization problem at interactive rates,\\nis there any hope of solving the richer IK formulation robustly?  Ideally\\nto global optimality?\\nThis is actually an extremely relevant question. There are many\\napplications of inverse kinematics that work offline and don't have any\\nstrict timing requirements. Imagine if you wanted to generate training\\ndata to train a neural network to learn your inverse kinematics; this\\nwould be a perfect application for global IK. Or if you want to do\\nworkspace analysis to see if the robot can reach all of the places it\\nneeds to reach in the workspace that you're designing for it, then you'd\\nlike to use global IK. Some of the motion planning strategies that we'll\\nstudy below will also separate their computation into an offline\\n\\\"building\\\" phase to make the online \\\"query\\\" phase much faster.\\nIn my experience, general-purpose global nonlinear solvers -- for\\ninstance, based on mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) approaches\\nor the interval arithmetic used in\\nsatisfiability-modulo-theories (SMT)\\nsolvers -- typically don't scale the complexity of a full manipulator.\\nBut if we only slightly restrict the class of costs and constraints that\\nwe support, then we can begin to make progress.\\nDrake provides an implementation of the\\nGlobalInverseKinematics\\napproach described in\\nDai17\\nusing mixed-integer convex\\noptimization. The solution times are on the order of a few seconds; it\\ncan solve a full constrained bimanual problem in well under a minute.\\nTrutman22\\nsolves the narrow version of the problem (just\\nend-effector poses and joint limits) using convex optimization via a\\nhierarchy of semi-definite programming relaxations; it would be very\\ninteresting to understand how well this approach works with the larger\\nfamily of costs and constraints.\\nInverse kinematics vs differential inverse kinematics\\nWhen should we use IK vs Differential IK?  IK solves a more global\\nproblem, but is not guaranteed to succeed.  It is also not guaranteed to\\nmake small changes to $q$ as you make small changes in the\\ncost/constraints; so you might end up sending large $\\\\Delta q$ commands\\nto your robot.  Use IK when you need to solve the more global problem,\\nand the trajectory optimization algorithms we produce in the next section\\nare the natural extension to producing actual $q$ trajectories.\\nDifferential IK works extremely well for incremental motions -- for\\ninstance if you are able to design smooth commands in end-effector space\\nand simply track them in joint space.\\nGrasp planning using inverse kinematics\\nIn our first version of\\ngrasp\\nselection\\nusing sampling, we put an objective that rewarded grasps\\nthat were oriented with the hand grasping from above the object. This was\\na (sometimes poor) surrogate for the problem that we really wanted to\\nsolve: we want the grasp to be achievable given a \\\"comfortable\\\" position\\nof the robot. So a simple and natural extension of our grasp scoring\\nmetric would be to solve an inverse kinematics problem for the grasp\\ncandidate, and instead of putting costs on the end-effector orientation,\\nwe can use the joint-centering cost directly as our objective.\\nFurthermore, if the IK problem returns infeasible, we should reject the\\nsample.\\nThere is a quite nice extension of this idea that becomes natural once\\nwe take the optimization view, and it is a nice transition to the\\ntrajectory planning we'll do in the next section.  Imagine if the task\\nrequires us not only to pick up the object in clutter, but also to place\\nthe object carefully in clutter as well. In this case, a good grasp\\ninvolves a pose for the hand relative to the object that\\nsimultaneously optimizes\\nboth the pick configuration and the place\\nconfiguration. One can formulate an optimization problem with decision\\nvariables for both $q_{pick}$ and $q_{place}$, with constraints enforcing\\nthat ${}^OX^{G_{pick}} = {}^OX^{G_{place}}$. Of course we can still add\\nin all of our other rich costs and constraints, In the\\ndish-loading project at TRI\\n, this\\napproach proved to be very important. Both picking up a mug in the sink\\nand placing it in the dishwasher rack are highly constrained, so we\\nneeded the simultaneous optimization to find successful grasps.\\nSimple code example here\\nKinematic trajectory optimization\\nOnce you understand the optimization perspective of inverse kinematics, then you\\nare well on your way to understanding kinematic trajectory optimization. Rather than\\nsolving multiple inverse kinematics problems independently, the basic idea now is to\\nsolve for a sequence of joint angles simultaneously in a single optimization. Even\\nbetter, let us define a parameterized joint trajectory, $q_\\\\alpha(t)$, where\\n$\\\\alpha$ is a vector of parameters. Then a simple extension to our inverse\\nkinematics problem would be to write something like \\\\begin{align} \\\\min_{\\\\alpha,T} &\\n\\\\quad T, \\\\\\\\ \\\\subjto &\\\\quad X^{G_{start}} = f_{kin}(q_\\\\alpha(0)),\\\\\\\\ & \\\\quad\\nX^{G_{goal}} = f_{kin}(q_\\\\alpha(T)), \\\\\\\\ & \\\\quad \\\\forall t , \\\\quad\\n\\\\left|\\\\dot{q}_\\\\alpha(t)\\\\right| \\\\le v_{max} \\\\label{eq:vel_limits}. \\\\end{align} I read\\nthis as \\\"find a trajectory, $q_\\\\alpha(t)$ for $t \\\\in [0, T]$, that moves the gripper\\nfrom the start to the goal in minimum time\\\".\\nThe last equation, (\\\\ref{eq:vel_limits}), represents velocity limits;\\nthis is the only way we are telling the optimizer that the robot cannot\\nteleport instantaneously from the start to the goal. Apart from this line\\nwhich looks a little non-standard, it is almost exactly like solving two\\ninverse kinematics problems jointly, except instead of having the solver\\ntake gradients with respect to $q$, we will take gradients with respect to\\n$\\\\alpha$. This is easily accomplished using the chain rule.\\nTrajectory parameterizations\\nThe interesting question, then, becomes how do we actually\\nparameterize the trajectory $q(t)$ with a parameter vector $\\\\alpha$?\\nThese days, you might think that $q_\\\\alpha(t)$ could be a neural network\\nthat takes $t$ as an input, offers $q$ as an output, and uses $\\\\alpha$ to\\nrepresent the weights and biases of the network. Of course you could, but\\nfor inputs with a scalar input like this, we often take much simpler and\\nsparser parameterizations, often based on polynomials.\\nThere are many ways one can parameterize a trajectory with\\npolynomials. For example in\\ndynamic\\nmotion planning,\\ndirect\\ncollocation methods\\nuse\\npiecewise-cubic\\npolynomials\\nto represent the state trajectory, and the\\npseudo-spectral\\nmethods\\nuse Lagrange polynomials. In each case, the choice of basis\\nfunctions is made so that algorithm can leverage a particular property of\\nthe basis. In dynamic motion planning, a great deal of focus is on the integration accuracy of the dynamic equations to ensure that we obtain feasible solutions to the dynamic constraints.\\nWhen we are planning the motions of our fully-actuated robot arms, we\\ntypically worry less about dynamic feasibility, and focus instead on the\\nkinematics. For\\nkinematic\\ntrajectory optimization, the so-called\\nB-spline\\ntrajectory\\nparameterization has a few particularly nice properties\\nthat we can leverage here:\\nThe derivative of a B-spline is still a B-spline (the degree is\\nreduced by one), with coefficients that are linear in the original\\ncoefficients.\\nThe bases themselves are non-negative and sparse.\\nThis gives the coefficients of the B-spline polynomial, which are\\nreferred to as the\\ncontrol points\\n, a strong geometric\\ninterpretation.\\nIn particular, the entire trajectory is guaranteed to lie inside the\\nconvex hull of the active control points (the control points who's bases\\nare not zero).\\nTaken together this means that we can optimize over finitely\\nparameterized trajectories, but use the convex hull property to ensure\\nthat limits on the joint positions and any of its derivatives are\\nsatisfied $\\\\forall t\\\\in [0,T]$ using\\nlinear\\nconstraints.  This\\nsort of guarantee would be much more costly to obtain using most other\\npolynomial bases.\\nWrite up the B-spline math here; and clean up the Drake\\nnotation/implementation in the process. In particular, I want to purge\\nthe use of symbolic from KinematicTrajectoryOptimization. My\\n`RussTedrake/drake:bsplinebasis_derivatives` branch has a start at\\ngetting analytical derivatives for the trajopt workflow.\\nNote that\\nB-splines\\nare closely\\nrelated to\\nB\\u00e9zier\\ncurves\\n. But the \\\"B\\\" in \\\"B-spline\\\" actually just stands for \\\"basis\\\"\\n(no, I'm not kidding) and \\\"\\nB\\u00e9zier splines\\n\\\"\\nare slightly different.\\nA simple interactive gui for moving around the control points and visualizing the spline.\\nOptimization algorithms\\nThe default\\nKinematicTrajectoryOptimization\\nclass in Drake optimizes a trajectory defined using a B-spline to\\nrepresent a path, $r(s)$ over the interval $s \\\\in [0,1]$, plus an\\nadditional scalar decision variable corresponding to the trajectory\\nduration, $T$. The final trajectory combines the path with the\\ntime-rescaling: $q(t) = r(t/T).$ This is a particularly nice way to\\nrepresent a trajectory of unknown duration, and has the excellent feature\\nthat the convex hull property can still be used. Velocity constraints are\\nstill linear; constraints on acceleration and higher derivatives do\\nbecome nonlinear, but if satisfied they still imply strict bounds\\n$\\\\forall t \\\\in [0, T].$\\nSince the\\nKinematicTrajectoryOptimization\\nis written\\nusing Drake's\\nMathematicalProgram\\n, by default it will\\nautomatically select what we think is the best solver given the available\\nsolvers. If the optimization has only convex costs and constraints, it\\nwill be dispatched to a convex optimization solver. But most often we add\\nin nonconvex\\ncosts\\nand constraints from kinematics\\n. Therefore in most cases, the default\\nsolver would again be the SQP-solver, SNOPT. You are free to experiment\\nwith others!\\nOne of the most interesting set of constraints that we can add to our\\nkinematic trajectory optimization problem is the\\nMinimumDistanceLowerBoundConstraint\\n;\\nwhen the minimum distance between all potential collision pairs is\\ngreater than zero then we have avoided collisions. Please note, though,\\nthat these collision constraints can only be enforced at discrete\\nsamples, $s_i \\\\in [0,1]$, along the path.\\nThey do not guarantee that\\nthe trajectory is collision free $\\\\forall t\\\\in[0,T].$\\nIt required\\nvery special properties of the derivative constraints to leverage the\\nconvex hull property; we do not have them for more general nonlinear\\nconstraints. A common strategy is to add constraints at some modest\\nnumber of samples along the interval during optimization, then to check\\nfor collisions more densely on the optimized trajectory before executing\\nit on the robot.\\nKinematic trajectory optimization for moving between shelves\\nAs a warm-up, I've provided a simple example of the planar iiwa\\nreaching from the top shelf into the middle shelf.\\nIf you look carefully at the code, I actually had to solve this\\ntrajectory optimization twice to get SNOPT to return a good solution\\n(unfortunately, since it is a local optimization, this can happen). For\\nthis particular problem, the strategy that worked was to solve once\\nwithout the collision avoidance constraint, and then use that\\ntrajectory as an initial guess for the problem with the collision\\navoidance constraint.\\nAnother thing to notice in the code is the \\\"visualization callback\\\"\\nthat I use to plot a little blue line for the trajectory as the\\noptimizer is solving. Visualization callbacks are implemented by e.g.\\ntelling the solver about a cost function that depends on all of the\\nvariables, and always returns zero cost; they get called every time the\\nsolver evaluates the cost functions. What I've done here can definitely\\nslow down the optimization, but it's an excellent way to get some\\nintuition about when the solver is \\\"struggling\\\" to numerically solve a\\nproblem. I think that the people / papers in this field with the\\nfastest and most robust solvers are highly correlated with people who\\nspend time visualizing and massaging the numerics of their solvers.\\nKinematic trajectory optimization for clutter clearing\\nWe can use\\nKinematicTrajectoryOptimization\\nto do the\\nplanning for our clutter clearing example, too. This optimization was\\nmore robust, and did not require solving twice. I only seeded it with a\\ntrivial initial trajectory to avoid solutions where the robot tried to\\nrotate 270 degrees around its base instead of taking the shorter\\npath.\\nShow example(s) from TRI dish-loading.\\nThere are a number of related approaches to kinematic trajectory\\noptimization in the motion planning literature, which differ either by\\ntheir parameterization or by the solution technique (or both). Some of\\nthe more well-known include CHOMP\\nRatliff09a\\n, STOMP\\nKalakrishnan11a\\n, and\\nKOMO\\nToussaint17\\n.\\nKOMO, for instance, is one of a handful of trajectory optimization\\ntechniques that use the\\nAugmented\\nLagrangian method\\nof transcribing a constrained optimization problem\\ninto an unconstrained problem, then using a simple but fast\\ngradient-based solver\\nToussaint14\\n. Augmented-Lagrangian-based\\napproaches appear to be the most popular and successful these days; I\\nhope to provide a nice implementation in Drake soon! But one does have to\\nbe careful in comparing these different solvers -- SNOPT may declare\\nfailure if it cannot optimize the cost and satisfy constraints to the\\ndefault tolerances (around 1e-6), while an Augmented-Lagrangian approach\\nwill never report failure and will rarely aim for this level of accuracy.\\nWhen kinematic trajectory optimizations succeed, they are an\\nincredibly satisfying solution to the motion planning problem. They give\\na very natural and expressive language for specifying the desired motion\\n(with needing to sample nonlinear constraints as perhaps the one\\nexception), and they can be solved fast enough for online planning. The\\nonly problem is: they don't always succeed. Because they are based on\\nnonconvex optimization, they are susceptible to local minima, and can\\nfail to find a feasible path even when one exists.\\nLocal minima in collision-free trajectory optimization\\nConsider the extremely simple example of finding the shortest path\\nfor a point robot moving from the start (blue circle) to the goal\\n(green circle) in the image below, avoiding collisions with the red\\nbox. Avoiding even the complexity of B-splines, we can write an\\noptimization of the form: \\\\begin{aligned} \\\\min_{q_0, ..., q_N} \\\\quad &\\n\\\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} | q_{n+1} - q_n|_2^2 & \\\\\\\\ \\\\text{subject to} \\\\quad &\\nq_0 = q_{start} \\\\\\\\ & q_N = q_{goal} \\\\\\\\ & |q_n|_1 \\\\ge 1 & \\\\forall n,\\n\\\\end{aligned} where the last line is the collision-avoidance constraint\\nsaying that each sample point has to be\\noutside\\nof the\\n$\\\\ell_1$-ball (my convenient choice for the geometry of the red box).\\nAlternatively, we can write a slightly more advanced constraint to\\nmaintain that each\\nline segment\\nis outside of the obstacle\\n(rather than just the vertices). Here are some possible solutions to this optimization problem:\\nFix meshcat line width.\\nThe solution on the left is the (global) minimum for the problem;\\nthe solution on the right is clearly a local minima. Once a nonlinear\\nsolver is considering paths that go right around the obstacle, it is\\nvery unlikely to find a solution that goes left around the obstacle,\\nbecause the solution would have to get worse (violate the collision\\nconstraint) before it gets better.\\nMake a version of this with B-splines\\nTo deal with this limitation, the field of collision-free motion\\nplanning has trended heavily towards sampling-based methods.\\nSampling-based motion planning\\nMy aim is to have a complete draft of this section soon!

(optimized collision\\nchecking, weighted Euclidean distances, ...)\\nMotion Planning w/ Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS)\\nTrajectory optimization techniques allow for rich specifications of costs and\\nconstraints, including derivative constraints on continuous curves, and can scale to\\nhigh-dimensional configuration spaces, but they are fundamentally based on local\\n(gradient-based) optimization and suffer from local mimima. Sampling-based planners\\nreason more globally and provide a notion of (probabilistic) completeness, but\\nstruggle to accommodate derivative constraints on continuous curves and struggle in\\nhigh dimensions. Is there any way to get the best of both worlds?\\nMy students and I have been working on new approach to motion planning\\nthat attempts to bridge this gap. It builds on a general optimization\\nframework for mixing continuous optimization and combinatorial optimization\\n(e.g. on a graph), which we call \\\"Graphs of Convex Sets\\\" (GCS).\\nTo motivate it, let's think about why the PRM struggles to handle\\ncontinuous curvature constraints. During the roadmap construction phase, we\\ndo a lot of work with the collision checker to certify that straight line\\nsegments connecting two vertices are collision free (typically only up to\\nsome sampling resolution, though it is possible to do better\\nAmice23\\n). Then, in the online query phase, we search the discrete graph\\nto find a (discontinuous) piecewise-linear shortest path from the start to the goal.\\nOnce we go to smooth that path or approximate it with a continuous curve, there is\\nno guarantee that this path is still collision free, and it certainly might not be\\nthe shortest path. Because our offline roadmap construction only considered line\\nsegments, it didn't leave any room for online optimization. This becomes even more\\nof a concern when we bring in dynamics -- paths that are kinematically feasible\\nmight not be feasible once we have dynamic constraints. While sampling-based\\nplanning\\ncan be\\nadapted\\nto these so-called \\\"kino-dynamic planning\\\" or \\\"control-based planning\\\"\\nproblems, for a number of\\nsubtle reasons\\nthese\\nalgorithms have not been as successful as the purely kinematic sampling-based\\nplanning versions.\\nAdd a PRM => GCS plot here.\\nA relatively small change to the PRM workflow is this: every time we pick a\\nsample, rather than just adding the configuration-space point to the graph, let's\\nexpand that point into a (convex) region in configuration space. We'll happily pay\\nsome offline computation in order to find nice big regions, because the payoff for\\nthe online query phase is significant. First, we can make much sparser graphs -- a\\nsmall number of regions can cover a big portion of configuration space -- which also\\nallows us to scale to higher dimensions. But perhaps more importantly, now we have\\nthe flexibility to optimize online over continuous curves, so long as they stay\\ninside the convex regions. This requires a generalization of the graph-search\\nalgorithm which can jointly optimize the discrete path through the graph along with\\nthe parameters of the continuous curves; this is exactly the generalization that GCS\\nprovides.\\nGraphs of Convex Sets\\nThe GCS framework was originally introduced in\\nMarcucci21\\n, and we have a mature\\nimplementation\\nin Drake\\n. It is a general optimization framework for combining combinatorial\\noptimizations, like graph search, with continuous optimizations, like the\\nkinematic trajectory optimization we studied above. GCS can provide a continuous\\nextension to any \\\"network flow\\\" optimization (c.f.\\nAhuja93\\n), but for\\nmotion planning, the first problem we are interested in is shortest paths on a\\ngraph.\\nConsider the very classical problem of finding the (weighted) shortest\\npath from a source, $s$, to a target, $t,$ on a graph, pictured on the\\nleft. The problem is described by a set of vertices, a set of\\n(potentially directed) edges, and the cost of traversing each edge.\\nGCS provides a simple, but powerful generalization to this problem:\\nwhenever we visit a vertex in the graph, we are also allowed to pick one\\nelement out of a convex set associated with that vertex. Edge lengths are\\nallowed to be convex functions of the continuous variables in the\\ncorresponding sets, and we can also write convex constraints on the edges\\n(which must be satisfied by any solution path).\\nThe shortest path problem on a graph of convex sets can encode\\nproblems that are NP-Hard, but these can be formulated as a mixed-integer\\nconvex optimization (MICP). What makes the framework so powerful is that\\nthis MICP has a very strong and efficient\\nconvex relaxation\\n;\\nmeaning that if you relax the binary variables to continuous variables\\nyou get (nearly) the solution to the original MICP.  This means that you\\ncan solve GCS problems to global optimality orders of magnitude faster\\nthan previous transcriptions. But in practice, we find that\\nsolving\\nonly the convex relaxation\\n(plus a little rounding) is almost always\\nsufficient to recover the optimal solution. Nowadays, we almost never\\nsolve the full MICP in our robotics applications of GCS.\\nYou can find more details and examples about GCS in my\\nunderactuated notes\\n,\\nand a thorough and very readable treatment of GCS as a general tool for\\nmixed-discrete and continous optimization in\\nMarcucci24a\\n.\\nGCS (Kinematic) Trajectory Optimization\\nGCS provides a very general machinery for optimizing over the mixed\\ndiscrete/continuous optimization problems that are naturally represented on a\\ngraph. But how do we transcribe the motion planning problem into a GCS? We first\\npresented the transcription I'll describe here in the paper titled \\\"Motion\\nplanning around obstacles with convex optimization\\\"\\nMarcucci23a\\n. Since\\nwe've already spent time in this chapter talking about the inherent nonconvexity\\nof the motion planning problem, you can see why we like this title! It should be\\nslightly surprising that we can use convex optimization to effectively solve these\\nproblems to global optimality.\\nLet us assume for a moment that we are given a convex decomposition of the\\ncollision-free space. This is a strong assumption, which we will justify below.\\nLeft:\\nA simple 2D configuration-space with obstacles in red.\\nRight:\\nA convex decomposition of the collision-free configuration space.\\nObserve that if we have two points in the same convex collision-free region,\\nthen we know that the straight line connecting them is also guaranteed to be\\ncollision free. When points lie in the intersection of two C-space regions, then\\nthey can connect continuous paths through multiple regions. This is the essence of\\nour transcription. What this implies is that for each visit to a vertex in the\\nGCS, then we want to pick\\ntwo points\\nin a C-space region, so that the path\\nlies in the region. So the convex sets in the GCS are not the C-space regions\\nthemselves, they are the set with $2n$ variables for an $n$-dimensional\\nconfiguration space where the first $n$ and the last $n$ are both in the C-space\\nregion. In set notation, we'd say it's the Cartesian product of the set with\\nitself. We form undirected edges between these sets iff the C-space regions\\nintersect, and we put a constraint on each edge saying that the second point in\\nthe first set must be equal to the first point in the second set.\\nGcsTrajOpt in a simple 2D configuration space\\nLet's run GCS trajectory optimization on the simple configuration space\\ndepicted above. I've put the start in the bottom left corner and the goal in the\\ntop right. I'll run the algorithm twice, once with a minimum-distance objective,\\nand once with a minimum-time objective (and velocity constraints):\\nLeft:\\nThe GcsTrajOpt solution with a minimum-distance cost.\\nRight:\\nThe GcsTrajOpt solution with a minimum-time cost (and velocity constraints).\\nWe can generalize this significantly. Rather than just putting a line\\nsegment in each set, we can use the convex hull property of Bezier curves\\nto guarantee that an entire continuous path of fixed degree lies inside\\nthe set. Using the derivative properties of the Bezier curves, we can add\\nconvex constraints on the velocities (e.g. velocity limits), and\\nguarantee that the curves are smooth even at the intersections between\\nregions. To define these velocities, though, we need to know something\\nabout the rate at which we are traversing the path, so we also introduce\\nthe time-scaling parameterization, much like we did in the kinematic\\ntrajectory optimization above, with time scaling parameters in each\\nconvex set.\\nThe result is a fairly rich trajectory optimization framework that\\nencodes many (but admittedly not all) of the costs and constraints that\\nwe want for trajectory optimization in the GCS convex optimization\\nframework. For instance, we can write objectives that include:\\ntime (trajectory duration),\\npath length (approximated with an upper bound),\\nan upper bound on path \\\"energy\\\" (e.g. $\\\\int |\\\\dot{q}(t)|_2^2$),\\nand constraints that include:\\npath derivative continuity (to arbitrary\\ndegree),\\nvelocity constraints (strictly enforced for all $t$, not just at\\nsample points),\\nadditional convex position and/or path derivative constraints, such\\nas initial and final positions and velocities.\\nWe automatically impose path continuity constraints, and the region\\nconstraints (that the entire trajectory stays inside the union of the\\nC-space regions) which are guaranteed at all $t$, not just at sample points.\\nYou can find the\\nimplementation\\nin Drake here\\n.\\nGcsTrajOpt in a simple 2D configuration space (cont.)\\nThis is the result of running nearly the same minimum-time optimization as in\\nthe example above, but this time we parameterize each segment with a fifth order\\nBezier curve and a time scaling, and ask for continuity up to the fourth\\nderivative (\\\"snap\\\").\\nInspection of the trajectory derivatives reveals that the velocities are\\nsmooth and that they stay within the velocity bounds $[-1, 1]$ for the\\nentire\\ntrajectory; not just at sample points.\\nNonconvex trajectory optimization can, of course, consume richer costs and\\nconstraints, but does not have the global optimization and completeness elements\\nthat GCS can provide.  We are constantly adding more costs and constraints into\\nthe GCS Trajectory Optimization framework -- some seemingly nonconvex constraints\\nactually have an exact convex reformulation, others have nice convex\\napproximations. This leads to a natural merger of the two techniques: we can use\\nconvex approximations of more complex costs and constraints in the GCS convex\\nrelaxation, but then use nonlinear optimization during in the rounding step to\\nhandle the nonconvexity exactly once GCS selects the discrete path through the\\ngraph to give a strong initial guess\\nWrangel24\\n. This can be\\naccomplished in Drake via the\\nuse_in_transcription\\noption of the\\nAddCost\\nand\\nAddConstraint\\nmethods of\\nGCS, and adding nonconvex constraints only to the\\nTranscription::kRestriction\\n.\\nLots more examples\\nConvex decomposition of (collision-free) configuration\\nspace\\nOk, so how do we obtain a convex decomposition of collision-free configuration\\nspace? Let's start by taking the analogy with the PRM seriously. If we sample a\\ncollision-free point in the configuration space, then what is the right way to\\ninflate that point into a convex region?\\nThe answer is simpler when we are dealing with convex geometries. In\\nmy view, it is reasonable to approximate the geometry of a robot with\\nconvex shapes in the Euclidean space, $\\\\Re^3.$ Even though many robots\\n(like the iiwa) have nonconvex mesh geometries, we can often approximate\\nthem nicely as the union of simpler convex geometries; sometimes these\\nare primitives like cylinders and spheres, alternatively we can perform a\\nconvex decomposition directly on the mesh. But even when the geometries\\nare convex in the Euclidean space, it is generally\\nunreasonable\\nto\\ntreat them as convex in the configuration space.\\nThere are a few exceptions. If your configuration space only involves\\ntranslations, or if your robot geometry is invariant to rotations (e.g. a\\npoint robot or a spherical robot), then the configuration space will\\nstill be convex; this was one of the first key observations that cemented\\nthe notion of configuration space as a core mathematical object in\\nrobotics\\nLozano-Perez90\\n. This can work for a mobile robot\\n(even a quadrotor approximated by a sphere). In this case, one can easily\\ncompute the minimum Euclidean distance between any pairs of convex bodies\\nat the sample point, and for instance, inflate the point into a sphere of\\nthe appropriate radius\\nShkolnik11a\\n. In order to find bigger\\nregions, we have made heavy use of the Iterative Region Inflation by\\nSemidefinite Program (IRIS) algorithm introduced in\\nDeits14\\nand\\nimplemented\\nin Drake\\n. This algorithm alternates between finding separating\\nhyperplanes and finding the maximum volume contained ellipse to \\\"inflate\\\"\\nthe region to locally maximize (an efficient approximation of) the volume\\nof the region.\\nIt is possible to extend the IRIS algorithm to find large convex regions in the more general (nonconvex) configuration space. We've done it in two ways:\\nUsing nonlinear programming (NP)\\n. In the IRIS-NP algorithm\\nPetersen23a\\n(\\nimplemented\\nin Drake\\n), we replace the convex optimization for finding the closest\\ncollision with a nonlinear optimization solver like SNOPT. We randomly sample\\npotential collisions in order to make the algorithm probabilistically sound; in\\npractice this algorithm is relatively fast but does not\\nguarantee\\nthat\\nthe region is completely collision free. We've recently dramatically improve the\\nperformance of this pipeline with\\nIRIS-NP2\\n,\\nintroduced in\\nWerner24\\n, with creates bigger regions with less faces\\norders of magnitude faster than the original IRIS-NP.\\nUsing zero-order optimization (ZO)\\n. By replacing the nonlinear\\noptimization in IRIS-NP with a zeroth-order optimization (no gradients required;\\nit uses only samples), IRIS-ZO produces slightly smaller regions, but can be\\ntrivially parallelized\\nWerner24\\n.\\nUsing algebraic kinematics + sums-of-squares optimization\\n.\\nLeveraging the idea that the kinematics of most of our robots can be\\nexpressed using (rational) polynomials, we can use tools from\\npolynomial optimization to search for rigorous certificates of\\nnon-collision\\nDai23\\n(\\nimplemented\\nin Drake\\n). This method tends to be slower, but the results are\\nsound. The one sacrifice that we have to make here is that we find\\nconvex regions in the\\nstereographic\\nprojection\\ncoordinates of the original space. In practice, this represents a slight warping of the coordinate system (and consequently a trajectory length) over the region.\\nIRIS in Configuration Space\\nLet's run the\\nIrisInConfigurationSpace\\n(aka IRIS-NP) algorithm\\non the example of iiwa reaching into a shelf that we played with before. We will\\nuse the full 7 degrees of freedom of the arm, and the original collision\\ngeometry. I'd like for this example to demonstrate two things: (1) the mechanics\\nof using\\nIrisInConfigurationSpace\\nand (2) the fact that these IRIS\\nregions can cover a lot of volume, even when they are up against complicated\\nconfiguration-space geometries.\\nIrisInConfigurationSpace\\ncan be configured using a single seed\\npoint; iterations of the algorithm will start with a small region around that\\npoint and \\\"inflate\\\" it to maximize a local approximation of configuration space\\nvolume. We can find a seed configuration, $q,$ that is reaching inside the top\\nshelf using\\nInverseKinematics\\n. But if we only run IRIS from there,\\nthen the region it will find will not fill space inside the shelf, it will\\ninstead creep out of the shelf in order to cover the much larger configuration\\nspace outside of the shelf. To avoid this, we'll run IRIS twice; once with a\\nseed that is the \\\"home configuration\\\" of the robot, which will grow a region\\noutside the shelf. Then we'll run IRIS again with the IK seed inside the shelf,\\nbut with an additional constraint using the first region as an obstacle (asking\\nthat they do not overlap). This will force the second region to use the volume\\ninside the shelf to maximize volume.\\nA different approach for obtaining this volume, which I now favor, is to\\ncollect many configuration space samples in the region of interest using inverse\\nkinematics, then compute the\\nMinimumVolumeCircumscribedEllipsoid\\nto be used as the\\nstarting_ellipse\\nfor IRIS. Then we run only one iteration of IRIS to get a nice region with a\\nnotion of volume corresponding to covering this area of configuration space. This approach avoids the false constraint of using previous regions as obstacles (so leads to bigger regions), runs faster (due to using only one iteration of IRIS), and is more parallelizable.\\nIf we were to continue to follow the analogy with the PRM, then we could\\nimagine performing a convex decomposition of the space by sampling at random,\\nrejecting samples that are either in collision or in an existing IRIS region, and\\nthen inflating any remaining samples. But in fact, we can do much better than this\\n-- we can cover a larger percentage of the configuration free space with the same\\nnumber of regions, or alternatively cover a similar volume with less regions. Our\\ncurrent best algorithm for performing this convex decomposition proceeds by\\ncomputing a \\\"minimum clique cover\\\" of the \\\"visibility graph\\\"\\nWerner23\\n(\\nimplemented in Drake\\n).\\nGcsTrajOpt in a simple 2D configuration space (cont.)\\nIf we run the \\\"minimum clique cover\\\" algorithm with a coverage threshold of 96% of the configuration space on the simple 2D example, we obtain automatic decompositions like this:\\nIn practice, it seems reasonably tractable to try to compute a quite dense\\ncovering of the configuration space for 7-DOF manipulators, and perhaps even up to\\nsay 10 degrees of freedom. But for higher dimensions, I think that trying to cover\\nevery nook and cranny of the configuration space is a false goal. I strongly\\nprefer the idea of intializing the clique-cover algorithm with sample points that\\nrepresent the \\\"important\\\" regions of your configuration space. Sometimes we do\\nthis by manual seeding (via calls to inverse kinematics), or alternatively, we can\\ndo it by examining trajectories that come from teleop demonstrations, from\\nanother planner (that can generate plans, but without the same guarantees), or\\neven from a reinforcement learning policy.\\nThe IRIS Builder\\nHere is a notebook that contains a handful of different tools for steering\\nthe creation of your IRIS regions.\\nGcsTrajOpt Examples\\nWhat's the right cost function for smooth curves?\\niiwa reaching into shelves\\nBimanual iiwa\\nVariations and Extensions\\nFast path planning (FPP)\\nMarcucci23\\n.

Tobia said he also has some notes on the higher\\nderivatives.\\nOnce we have a motion plan, a natural question is: what is the fastest\\nthat we can execute that plan, subject to velocity, acceleration, and\\ntorque-limit constraints?\\nTo study this, let's once again define a trajectory $\\\\bq(t)$ defined over\\nthe interval $t \\\\in [t_0, t_f]$ via a path parameterization, ${\\\\bf r}(s)$,\\nand a time parameterization, $s(t)$, such that $$\\\\bq(t) = {\\\\bf r}(s(t)),\\n\\\\text{ where }s(t) \\\\in [0,1], s(t_0) = 0, s(t_f) = 1.$$ We will constrain\\n$\\\\forall t \\\\in [t_0, t_f], \\\\dot{s}(t) > 0,$ so that the inverse mapping\\nfrom $s$ to $t$ always exists. The advantage of this parameterization is\\nthat when ${\\\\bf r}(s)$ is fixed, many of the objectives and constraints\\nthat we might want to put on $\\\\bq(t)$ are actually convex in the\\nderivatives of $s(t).$ To see this, using the shorthand ${\\\\bf r}'(s) =\\n\\\\pd{\\\\bf r}{s}, {\\\\bf r}''(s) = \\\\pd{^2 {\\\\bf r}}{s^2},$ etc., write\\n\\\\begin{align*} \\\\dot\\\\bq &= {\\\\bf r}'(s)\\\\dot{s},\\\\\\\\ \\\\ddot\\\\bq(t) &= {\\\\bf r}''(s)\\n\\\\dot{s}^2 + {\\\\bf r}'(s)\\\\ddot{s}.\\\\end{align*} Even more important/exciting,\\nsubstituting these terms into the\\nmanipulator\\nequations\\nyields: $$\\\\bu(s) = {\\\\bf m}(s)\\\\ddot{s} + {\\\\bf c}(s)\\\\dot{s}^2 +\\n\\\\bar{\\\\bf \\\\tau}_g(s),$$ where $\\\\bu(s)$ is the commanded torque at the scaled\\ntime $s(t)$, and \\\\begin{align} {\\\\bf m}(s) &= {\\\\bf M}({\\\\bf r}(s)){\\\\bf\\nr}'(s), \\\\\\\\ {\\\\bf c}(s) &= {\\\\bf M}({\\\\bf r}(s)){\\\\bf r}''(s) + \\\\bC({\\\\bf r}(s),\\n{\\\\bf r}'(s)) {\\\\bf r}'(s), \\\\\\\\ \\\\bar{\\\\bf \\\\tau}_g(s) &= {\\\\bf \\\\tau}_g({\\\\bf\\nr}(s)).\\\\end{align}\\nThe next key step is to introduce a change of variables: $b(s(t)) =\\n\\\\dot{s}^2(t)  ,$ and note\\n\\u2020\\nthat $b'(s) = 2 \\\\ddot{s}.$\\n\\u2020\\nBecause $\\\\dot{b}(s) = b'(s)\\\\dot{s}$ and $\\\\dot{b}(s) =\\n2\\\\dot{s}\\\\ddot{s}.$\\nWe will use a parameterized trajectory to\\nrepresent $b(s)$ over the interval $s\\\\in[0,1]$. Let's see that we can write\\nan extremely useful set of costs and constraints as convex functions of\\n$b(s)$, evaluated at sampled time points, $s_i = s(t_i)$:\\nMonotonicity constraint: $$b(s_i) \\\\ge \\\\epsilon \\\\Rightarrow\\n\\\\dot{s}(t_i) >\\n0.$$\\nVelocity limits are bounding-box constraints: $$\\\\forall j,\\\\,\\n\\\\dot{q}_{min,j}^2 \\\\le r'_j(s_i)^2 b(s_i) \\\\le \\\\dot{q}_{max,j}^2 \\\\Rightarrow\\n\\\\dot{\\\\bq}_{min} \\\\le \\\\dot{\\\\bq}(t_i) \\\\le \\\\dot{\\\\bq}_{max}.$$\\nAcceleration limits are linear constraints: $$ \\\\ddot{\\\\bq}_{min} \\\\le\\n{\\\\bf r}''(s_i)b(s_i) + \\\\frac{1}{2} {\\\\bf r}'(s_i) b'(s_i) \\\\le\\n\\\\ddot{\\\\bq}_{max} \\\\Rightarrow \\\\ddot{\\\\bq}_{min} \\\\le \\\\ddot\\\\bq(t_i) \\\\le\\n\\\\ddot\\\\bq_{max}.$$\\nTorque limits are linear constraints: \\\\begin{gather*}\\\\bu_{min} \\\\le\\n\\\\frac{1}{2}{\\\\bf m}(s_i)b'(s_i) + {\\\\bf c}(s_i)b(s_i) + \\\\bar{\\\\bf \\\\tau}_g(s_i)\\n\\\\le \\\\bu_{max} \\\\Rightarrow\\\\\\\\ \\\\bu_{min} \\\\le \\\\bu(t_i) \\\\le\\n\\\\bu_{max}.\\\\end{gather*}\\nMinimizing the time duration is a convex\\nobjective: $$t_f - t_0 = \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_f} 1 dt = \\\\int_0^1\\n\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{b(s)}} ds.$$ This looks nonconvex, but can be written using\\n...\\nAlthough we would like that a finite number of constraints could be\\nsufficient to imply that these constraints hold over the entire time\\ninterval, $[t_0, t_f]$, in practice, we just enforce the constraints at a\\nsufficiently large number of sampled times and forgo the strict guarantees.\\nThese time-optimal path parameterizations (TOPP) were studied\\nextensively throughout the 1980's (e.g.\\nBobrow85\\n) with bespoke\\nalgorithms that, for instance, attempted to uncover all of the switching\\ntimes of the bang-bang trajectory.\\nVerscheure09+Debrouwere13+Lipp14\\nmade the connections to convex optimization that I've described here.\\nPham18\\nmade a popular numerical implementation of this called\\nTOPPRA\\n(time-optimal path parameterizations based on reachability analysis). We\\nmake heavy use of these ideas (and spell out the detailed\\nconnections to the Bezier curve parameterization) in\\nMarcucci23a\\n. You can find a\\nPathParameterizedTrajectory\\nclass in Drake.\\nOne common question is whether TOPP can be used to write convex\\nconstraints on the\\njerk\\n(or higher derivatives) of the trajectory,\\n$$\\\\dddot\\\\bq(t) = {\\\\bf r}'''(s) \\\\dot{s}^3(t) + 3{\\\\bf r}''(s) \\\\dot{s}(t)\\n\\\\ddot{s}(t) + {\\\\bf r}'(s)\\\\dddot{s}(t).$$ This comes up because many\\nindustrial robot manipulators have jerk limits that must be respected.\\nDebrouwere13\\naddressed a version of this question. (More soon...)\\nExercises\\nDoor Opening\\nFor this exercise, you will implement a optimization-based inverse kinematics solver to open a cupboard door. You will work exclusively in\\n. You will be asked to complete the following steps:\\nWrite down the constraints on the IK problem of grabbing a cupboard handle.\\nFormalize the IK problem as an instance of optimization.\\nImplement the optimization problem using MathematicalProgram.\\nRRT Motion Planning\\nFor this exercise, you will implement and analyze the RRT algorithm introduced in class. You will work exclusively in\\n. You will be asked to complete the following steps:\\nImplement the RRT algorithm for the Kuka arm.\\nAnswer questions regarding its properties.\\nImproving RRT Path Quality\\nDue to the random process by which nodes are generated, the paths output by RRT can often look somewhat jerky (the \\\"RRT dance\\\" is the favorite dance move of many roboticists). There are many strategies to improve the quality of the paths and in this question we'll explore two. For the sake of this problem, we'll assume path quality refers to path length, i.e. that the goal is to find the shortest possible path, where distance is measured as Euclidean distance in joint space.\\nOne strategy to improve path quality is to post-process paths via \\\"shortcutting\\\", which tries to replace existing portions of a path with shorter segments\\nGeraerts04\\n. This is often implemented with the following algorithm: 1) Randomly select two non-consecutive nodes along the path. 2) Try to connect them with a RRT's extend operator. 3) If the resulting path is better, replace the existing path with the new, better path. Steps 1-3 are repeated until a termination condition (often a finite number of steps or time). For this problem, we can assume that the extend operator is a straight line in joint space. Consider the graph below, where RRT has found a rather jerky path from $q_{start}$ to $q_{goal}$. There is an obstacle (shown in red) and $q_{start}$ and $q_{goal}$ are highlighted in blue (disclaimer: This graph was manually generated to serve as an illustrative example).\\nName one pair of nodes for which the shortcutting algorithm would result in a shorter path (i.e. two nodes along our current solution path for which we could produce a shorter path if we were to directly connect them). You should assume the distance metric is the 2D Euclidean distance.\\nShortcutting as a post-processing technique, reasons over the existing path and enables local \\\"re-wiring\\\" of the graph. It is a heuristic and does not, however, guarantee that the tree will encode the shortest path. To explore this, let's zoom in one one iteration of RRT (as illustrated below), where $q_{sample}$ is the randomly generated configuration, $q_{near}$ was the closest node on the existing tree and $q_{new}$ is the RRT extension step from $q_{near}$ in the direction of q_sample. When the standard RRT algorithm (which you implemented in\\na previous exercise\\n) adds $q_{new}$ to the tree, what node is its parent? If we wanted our tree to encode the shortest path from the starting node, $q_{start}$, to each node in the tree, what node should be the parent node of $q_{new}$?\\nThis idea of dynamically \\\"rewiring\\\" to discover the minimum cost path (which for us is the shortest distance) is a critical aspect of the asymptotically optimal variant of RRT known as RRT*\\nKaraman11\\n. As the number of samples tends towards infinity RRT* finds the optimal path to the goal! This is unlike \\\"plain\\\" RRT, which is provably suboptimal (the intuition for this proof is that RRT \\\"traps\\\" itself because it cannot find better paths as it searches).\\nDecomposing Obstacle-Free Space with Convex Optimization\\nFor this exercise, you will implement part of the IRIS algorithm\\nDeits14\\n, which is used to compute large regions of obstacle-free space through a series of convex optimizations. These regions can be used by various planning methods that search for trajectories from start to goal while remaining collision-free. You will work exclusively in\\n. You will be asked to complete the following steps:\\nImplement a QP that finds the closest point on an obstacle to an ellipse in free-space.\\nImplement the part of the algorithm that searches for a set of hyperplanes that separate a free-space ellipse from all the obstacles.\\nReferences\\nMaurice Fallon and Scott Kuindersma and Sisir Karumanchi and Matthew Antone and Toby Schneider and Hongkai Dai and Claudia P\\u00e9rez D'Arpino and Robin Deits and Matt DiCicco and Dehann Fourie and Twan Koolen and Pat Marion and Michael Posa and Andr\\u00e9s Valenzuela and Kuan-Ting Yu and Julie Shah and Karl Iagnemma and Russ Tedrake and Seth Teller\\n,\\n\\\"An Architecture for Online Affordance-based Perception and Whole-body Planning\\\"\\n,\\nJournal of Field Robotics\\n, vol. 32, no. 2, pp. 229-254, September,\\n2014\\n.\\n[\\nlink\\n]\\nPat Marion and Maurice Fallon and Robin Deits and Andr\\u00e9s Valenzuela and Claudia P\\u00e9rez D'Arpino and Greg Izatt and Lucas Manuelli and Matt Antone and Hongkai Dai and Twan Koolen and John Carter and Scott Kuindersma and Russ Tedrake\\n,\\n\\\"Director: A User Interface Designed for Robot Operation With Shared Autonomy\\\"\\n,\\nJournal of Field Robotics\\n, vol. 1556-4967,\\n2016\\n.\\n[\\nlink\\n]\\nCharles W.

Blog Assignment\\nConclusion\\nIn this chapter, you have learned about some of the foundational concepts and debates in Chicanx and Latinx Studies. There are many more topics that are covered in this field and opportunities for additional exploration and learning. This overview provides some of the key information and perspectives that can guide this process. By examining the roots of Chicanx and Latinx Studies within the movements for Ethnic Studies, we can recognize important theories and knowledge produced by Chicanx and Latinx communities to recognize a more truthful and accurate understanding of history, culture, politics, and society.\\nFurthermore, we have seen that Chicanx and Latinx Studies is similar to other Ethnic Studies fields because it is rooted in struggle and resistance for racial justice and in solidarity with movements for decolonization. These struggles inform the significance of scholarship and inquiry in these areas, including with respect to identity formation, language access, healthcare, politics, and more. While Chicanx and Latinx communities have experienced substantial barriers related to systemic racism, settler-colonialism, and other interlocking forms of exploitation, this has only served to motivate communities to rally for justice, equity, self-determination, and liberation.\\nKey Terms\\nLULAC:\\nLeague of United Latin American Citizens, a nationwide group committed to advancing the economic condition, educational attainment, political influence, housing, health and civil rights of Latinxs through community-based programs. LULAC created the little school of 400.\\nEast L.A. Blowouts:\\nAlso known as the East L.A. Walkouts, are widely regarded as catapulting the Chicano Movement forward in the late 60\\u2019s and through the 70\\u2019s. The Blowouts were a series of walkouts carried out in 1968 by Mexican American students in protest against the educational inequality they faced in their schools and classrooms.\\nM.E.Ch.A.:\\nMovimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztl\\u00e1n (Chicano Student Movement of Aztlan) was created in order to have a Mexican American united front (Mu\\u00f1oz, Jr., 2007, p.96). M.E.Ch.A was created because of the need to unify Chicanx and Mexican American student organizations at various campuses (Rosales, 1997, p. 183).\\nChicanx:\\nCommonly accepted as \\u201cconnoting political awareness or consciousness and refers to U.S. born persons of Mexican descent\\u201d (Vargas, 2017, p. xxi). Additionally, it has been used to reclaim a word that was originally pejorative, inverting it by rooting it in the positive of their existence within Aztlan. (Gonzalez, 2022, p. 117).\\nLatinx:\\nThe term Latinx is developed as a method to drop the traditional patriarchal dichotomy of identifying simply as a male or female through ethnic identifiers such as Latinx.\\nIndigenismo:\\nAn \\u201cAztec-centric celebration of the Indigenous past of the nation, which often serves to erase the present and future of the sixty-three Indigenous pueblos of Mexico\\u201d and the millions of Indigenous peoples living around the world (Blackwell et al., 2017, p. 131).\\nChicanx Indigenous:\\nIt is a self-identity category used by people, unlike Hispanic or Latinx which emerged from western institutions. Chicanx is an identity term that originates from Xicano which stems from Mexicano that has roots in Mexica -- one of the central Indigenous groups in Mesoamerica (Anahuac).\\nAnahuac:\\nA nahua word, signifies someone from Mesoamerica.\\nMestizas/os/xs:\\nA diverse population that has a combination of mixed heritage, often including Indigenous lineage, along with a combination of African and/or European backgrounds. Across these diverse groups, some have experienced contemporary forced acculturation, and others have been taught to believe they can assimilate and be invested in the dominant Spanish or Anglo American cultural ways. The investment in whiteness is sometimes experienced through colorism when children are born as they may be referred to as being a g\\u00fcerita/o or morenita/o, if they have light or dark skin, respectively. Children\\u2019s light skin may be celebrated guided by the belief that they may eventually pass as white, which leads to identity conflict and pressure throughout development.\\nMestizaje:\\nMixed-race identity, emphasizing the multiple lineages that not only shape individual identity, but also the communities, cultures, languages, and traditions that we practice.\\nAfro-Latinx:\\nPeople from Latin America of African descent. The histories and identities of Afro-descendant people and Indigenous peoples in the Americas have been interacting and intertwined for centuries.\\nImmigrant and Immigration Policy:\\nImmigration policy is about the laws and policies that determine the process and number of people who can immigrate in various ways, whereas\\nimmigrant\\npolicy refers to the laws and regulations that impact immigrants currently residing in the country.\\nInstitutional health care\\nis healthcare provided by hospitals, doctors, physicians, prescribed medications, surgical procedures, and psychiatric appointments, which typically involve insurance.\\nTraditional Health:\\nIndigenous ways of health and healing of\\ncuerpo y alma\\n(body and soul) mediated through\\ncuranderas/os\\n(healers) or other specialists, like\\nparteras\\n(midwifes) and involves\\nremedios\\n(medicinal herbs), ceremonies,\\nlimpias\\n(spiritual cleansings),\\nsobaras/os\\n(message),\\nhuezera/o\\n(bone setter), informal counseling for\\nbilis\\n(rage),\\nsusto\\n(fright), or\\nenvido\\n(envy), ancestral foodways.\\nAssimilation\\n: The cultural (diet, language, dress, etc.), economic, and psychological pressures, especially for immigrants, to conform and reconfigure themselves to fit the culture of the dominant group.\\nLatino Health Paradox:\\nImmigrant Mexican and Latinx people will report better health and longer life expectancy compared to their acculturated Mexican origin and Latinx counterparts and European Americans of higher class statuses. Despite experiencing discrimination and institutional exclusion, which are typically risk factors that exacerbate bad health, recent migrants can carry forward strong traditions of resilience and well-being.\\nDiscussion Questions\\nIndigenous perspectives and western knowledge have conflicted over the beginning of human life on this planet, reflecting distinct standpoints. Recent evidence has shown that the hypothesis that humans in the western hemisphere migrated from Asia over a land bridge is not supported. Indigenous perspectives center on a relationship with the land since time immemorial. How do stories about where we come from shape our sense of self? How do these perspectives show a different understanding of the relationship between people and the land?\\nResearchers, including Indigenous archeologists and anthropologists, continue to investigate these issues and identify new evidence about the historical conditions where human life developed. You can supplement your discussion with contemporary sources, such as the websites linked here:\\nScientists in Chile have found a 15,000-year-old footprint, the earliest sign of humans' presence in the Americas | CNN Travel\\n68 VOCES\\n(Espa\\u00f1ol with English description available at Cinema Tropical:\\nWatch Mexican Indigenous Tales in Their Native Language in 68 VOICES, 68 HEARTS\\n)\\n\\u200b\\u200bStudents have been a major part of Chicanx and Latinx social movements. This includes advocacy around education and schools specifically, as well as broader movements for justice and liberation. Why are students uniquely situated to advocate for their communities?\\nYou can help guide this discussion by providing some examples of student advocacy as a jumping-off point. The websites linked in this list include just a few examples of student activism in Chicanx and Latinx social movements.\\nUWM Latino Activism | UWM Libraries Digital Collections\\n10 Young Latinx Activists You Should Know | DoSomething.org\\nThe Student Protest That Heralded the Chicano Movement\\nIndividuals who break through barriers are often celebrated for being the first of their kind, such as Sonia Sotomayor being appointed to be the first Latinx person on the U.S. Supreme Court. These figures become role models, or what some call \\u201cpossibility models.\\u201d Why does it matter that people see others like them represented? How does this representation affect communities as a whole?\\nYou can inform this discussion by examining specific figures who have broken barriers in representation. The websites in this list contain some biographical descriptions that can be used as a starting place. It can be even more powerful to tailor these to your local context or a specific field of interest.\\nFamous Firsts by Hispanic Americans\\nSonia Sotomayor and 9 Other Latina Pioneers of the 19th, 20th, and 21st Centuries - Biography\\n10 Inspiring Latinas Who\\u2019ve Made History \\u2014 Google Arts & Culture\\nJournal Prompts\\nIs there power in a name or in naming? Please write about one new organization or concept that you learned from this chapter. Please provide examples in your analysis.\\nWhat is Chicanx and Latinx? What are the differences and similarities between these terms?\\nStories are vital because they are how we shape our own narratives and create self-assigned identities. The terms that we use to identify ourselves are part of the stories and narratives that we tell. What are the stories and narratives that you utilize to identify yourself?\\nClass Activities\\nPower Mapping\\nAll advocacy is tailored toward a specific audience. The technique of \\u201cpower mapping\\u201d can be used to identify potential viable targets for a social movement. As illustrated in Figure 7.99, the basic structure of power mapping is to create a chart. In this chart, the vertical axis is based on influence. At the top of the chart, you will place individuals and organizations that are the most influential with respect to your defined outcome. As you go down the chart, you will place individuals who are less influential. At the same time, the horizontal axis represents support or opposition, with the leftmost part of the chart being the most opposition, and the rightmost part of the chart being the most support\\nTo complete the activity, create your own power map.\\nStart by clearly defining an objective, which should be specifically defined. This might be a policy, or working to eliminate a concrete disparity, like improving high school graduation rates among Chicanxs and Latinxs, or addressing a specific health disparity within your city, county, or state.\\nThen, begin filling out the chart relative to that issue by identifying individuals and organizations and estimating their amount of influence and support to place them on the chart.\\nYou can start with the folx you are most familiar with. You may want to also look up elected officials or policymakers, such as legislators, mayors, or appointed representatives. Some of these people and organizations will be listed in news articles on your topic.\\nTo complete the chart, identify the four groups that you have mapped:\\nChampions: Individuals who are high in influence and support your objective.\\nSupporters: Individuals who are low in influence and support your objective.\\nTargets: Individuals who are high in influence but oppose your objective.\\nOpponents: Individuals who are low in influence and oppose your objective.\\nFinally, reflect on what you have learned from this process in a short written response (250-500 words), focusing on the question: how can the identified champions and supporters of your issue work to influence the targets and opponents?\\nNote that successful social movements do not always win over all of their targets and opponents to become in favor of the objective. Sometimes the most effective way to meet an outcome is to move Targets from opposition to neutrality. And Opponents may continue to work against your objective, but this is not always impactful if they do not have influence.\\nGroup Blog Assignment\\nDemonstrate your interpretation of and engagement with a topic of your choice related to Chicanx and Latinx Studies.\\nAddress the following general prompts:\\nHow does the topic you chose to research relate to Chicanx and Latinx communities?\\nWhat is the relationship between your topic and Chicanx and Latinx identities, along with intersectional factors?(for example, gender, sexuality, immigration status, or ability status)\\nYou should use multiple sources to inform your contribution, such as written text, images, music, videos, and more.\\nFormat Options\\nFor an individual assignment, you can complete this independently. It can also be completed as a group, either by having each student complete an individual assignment and sharing it in a group format (e.g., Canvas discussion, free blog site, online Jamboard), or by having people work in groups to formulate and execute their blog contributions.\\nYou can specify the format or a range of options for the format to make the blog post assignment more engaging. For example, instead of a traditional blog post, students can make Instagram stories or short videos.\\nThis page titled\\n6.7: Summary/Review\\nis shared under a\\nCC BY-NC  4.0\\nlicense and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by\\nMario Alberto Viveros Espinoza-Kulick & Ulysses Acevedo\\n(\\nASCCC Open Educational Resources Initiative (OERI)\\n) .\\nBack to top\\n6.6: Special Topics in Chicanx and Latinx Studies\\n6.8: References\\nWas this article helpful?\\nYes\\nNo\\nRecommended articles\\nArticle type\\nSection or Page\\nAuthor\\nKay Fischer, Mario Alberto Viveros Espinoza-Kulick, Ulysses Acevedo, Teresa Hodges, Melissa Leal, and Tamara Cheshire\\nLicense\\nCC BY-NC\\nLicense Version\\n4.0\\nOER program or Publisher\\nASCCC OERI Program\\nShow TOC\\nno\\nTags\\nauthor@Mario Alberto Viveros Espinoza-Kulick & Ulysses Acevedo\\n\\u00a9 Copyright 2025 Social Sci LibreTexts\\nPowered by CXone Expert\\n\\u00ae\\nThe LibreTexts libraries are\\nPowered by NICE CXone Expert\\nand are supported by the Department of Education Open Textbook Pilot Project, the UC Davis Office of the Provost, the UC Davis Library, the California State University Affordable Learning Solutions Program, and Merlot.

How to cite these notes, use annotations, and give feedback. Note: These are working notes used for a course being taught at MIT . They will be updated throughout the Fall 2024 semester. Previous Chapter Table of contents Next Chapter Motion Planning There are a few more essential skills that we need in our toolbox. In this chapter, we will explore some of the powerful methods of kinematic trajectory motion planning. I'm actually almost proud of making it this far into the notes without covering this topic yet. Writing a relatively simple script for the pose of the gripper, like we did in the bin picking chapter, really can solve a lot of interesting problems. But there are a number of reasons that we might want a more automated solution: When the environment becomes more cluttered, it is harder to write such a simple solution, and we might have to worry about collisions between the arm and the environment as well as the gripper and the environment. If we are doing \\\"mobile manipulation\\\" -- our robotic arms are attached to a mobile base -- then the robot might have to operate in many different environments. Even if the workspace is not geometrically complicated, it might still be different enough each time we reach that it requires automated (but possibly still simple) planning. If the robot is operating in a simple known environment all day long, then it probably makes sense to optimize the trajectories that it is executing; we can often speed up the manipulation process significantly. In fact, if you ran the clutter clearing demo , I would say that motion planning failures were the biggest limitation of that solution so far: the hand or objects could sometimes collide with the cameras or bins, or the differential-inverse kinematics strategy (which effectively ignored the joint angles) would sometime cause the robot to fold in on itself. In this chapter we'll develop the tools to make that much better! I do need to make one important caveat. For motion planning in manipulation, lots of emphasis is placed on the problem of avoiding collisions. Despite having done some work in this field myself, I actually really dislike the problem formulation of collision-free motion planning. I think that on the whole, robots are too afraid of bumping into the world (because things still go wrong when they do). I don't think humans are solving these complex geometric problems every time we reach... even when we are reaching in dense clutter. I actually suspect that we are very bad at solving them. I would much rather see robots that perform well even with very coarse / approximate plans for moving through a cluttered environment, that are not afraid to make incidental contacts, and that can still accomplish the task when they do! Inverse Kinematics The goal of this chapter is to solve for motion\",\n",

All opinions expressed in this article are owned by the author(s). In the 1980s, a set of historical city maps resurfaced to reveal a hidden facet of our neighborhoods\\u2014the redlined status. As it turns out, the implementation of these maps saved the housing sector and bolstered prosperity for some demographic groups but increased disparities in homeownership, wealth, and health for others. The structural inequalities set in place by federal policies over 80 years ago are still evident in communities today. As our nation continues to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the historic designations of a neighborhood between \\u201chazardous\\u201d and \\u201cbest\\u201d continue to parallel inequities in testing, case rates, fatalities, and vaccinations. These historic lessons shine a light on the importance of explicitly including an equity lens for current policy decisions, not only to address current disparities, but the lasting effect decades later. How did we get here? In 1933, President Roosevelt created the Home Owners\\u2019 Loan Corporation (HOLC) with the goal of bolstering a failing housing market during the Great Depression. The plan was to refinance home mortgages and expand home buying opportunities for Americans. In order to do this, the Home Owners\\u2019 Loan Corporation evaluated over 200 cities in the U.S. for neighborhoods of \\u201cmortgage security,\\u201d using data from local lenders, developers, and real estate appraisers. Each city\\u2019s neighborhood was graded on a four-level system: A, lined in green, was \\u201cbest,\\u201d with a low perceived risk for lenders; D, lined in red, was \\u201chazardous,\\u201d with a high perceived risk for lenders\\u2014these areas formed the basis for the term \\u201credlining.\\u201d When classifying neighborhoods, evaluators didn\\u2019t just look at current housing quality and rent and sale values, but also the color of the residents\\u2019 skin. In Birmingham, Alabama , an area with \\u201cexecutives, businessmen, and retired professional men\\u201d was graded as \\u201cbest\\u201d with an A rating, while an adjacent neighborhood described as a \\u201cnegro low-cost slum clearance project\\u201d was redlined with a D grading. HOLC grades were then adopted by private and public entities and became an essential component of housing sector decisions up until the 1970s. Over the course of these decades, the practice of redlining stymied the ability of residents in redlined areas\\u2014most of whom were Black Americans\\u2014from building wealth by restricting home ownership and appreciation of home values. How redlining harmed health With 89% of health explained by factors outside of medical care, careful\",\n",

Today we are seeing the effect of redlining in certain neighborhoods for example there are parts in Chicago where homes are in bad shape and there is a lot of poverty, which leads to disparities in health. Socially people are less prone to going out and meeting their neighbors because there is limited recourse\\u2019s like for example parks that are not considered safe. Historical Housing effects health because people are not as physically active as they should be which is also a big issue when it comes to people\\u2019s health. \\n\\n2. Gentrification impact the health and social identity of residents because they are sometimes forced to leave their neighborhood because the cost of living gets too high, it affects their health because there might be doctor offices that only accept better insurance that the minority might not have.
