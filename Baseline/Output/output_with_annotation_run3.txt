Newton's second law states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration, expressed as F = ma. Here, F is the net force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration. This law explains the quantitative relationship between force and motion. For example, if friction is neglected, a 2 kg object acted on by a 3 N force will experience an acceleration of 1.5 m/s².

User Annotations:
- F = ma: I know this formula, but I often get confused—what exactly causes acceleration?
- if friction is neglected: In exams, they often say to neglect friction. How do I know when it's okay to do that?
- a 2 kg object acted on by a 3 N force will experience an acceleration of 1.5 m/s²: I like this kind of example with numbers—it makes it easier to understand.

Question:
In Newton's second law, does acceleration just mean speeding up?

Please answer this question considering what the user is interested in, confused about, and has known.

Response:
No, acceleration in Newton's second law does not just mean speeding up. It refers to any change in velocity of an object, which could mean an increase or decrease in speed, or a change in direction. This change in velocity is caused by an external force applied to the object, which can include gravity, friction, or any other force. 

To answer your curiosity about when it's okay to neglect friction, this is often done to simplify calculations in basic physics problems. In the real world, almost all moving objects are subject to friction, which can slow down an object or make it stop completely. But in many physics problems, especially those concerning Newton's laws, excluding friction can make the problem simpler without substantially affecting the outcome.

Regarding real-life examples like the 2 kg object acted upon by a 3 N force, these indeed make understanding and applying Newton's second law easier. You can use this example as a reference point to imagine how different forces will affect objects of different masses.
