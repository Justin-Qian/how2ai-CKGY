Prompt:
Document:
Newton's second law states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration, expressed as F = ma. Here, F is the net force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration. This law explains the quantitative relationship between force and motion. For example, if friction is neglected, a 2 kg object acted on by a 3 N force will experience an acceleration of 1.5 m/sÂ².

Question:
In Newton's second law, does acceleration just mean speeding up?

Please answer this question considering what the user is interested in, confused about, and has known.

Response:
No, acceleration in Newton's second law does not just mean speeding up. Acceleration refers to any change in velocity, which includes speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction. Acceleration is a vector quantity, so it includes both the magnitude and direction of the velocity change.
