Document:
Newton's second law states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration, expressed as F = ma. Here, F is the net force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration. This law explains the quantitative relationship between force and motion. For example, if friction is neglected, a 2 kg object acted on by a 3 N force will experience an acceleration of 1.5 m/s².

User Annotations:
- F = ma: I know this formula, but I often get confused—what exactly causes acceleration?
- if friction is neglected: In exams, they often say to neglect friction. How do I know when it's okay to do that?
- a 2 kg object acted on by a 3 N force will experience an acceleration of 1.5 m/s²: I like this kind of example with numbers—it makes it easier to understand.

Question:
In Newton's second law, does acceleration just mean speeding up?

Please answer this question considering what the user is interested in, confused about, and has known.

Response:
No, acceleration in Newton's second law doesn't just mean speeding up. Acceleration is a change in velocity, which can involve speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction. It is caused by a net force acting on an object. For example, when you push a stationary object, it starts moving—that's an acceleration caused by your force. If an object is already in motion and you apply force, it can move faster (speed up), slower (slow down), or in a different direction, all indicating acceleration.

Regarding your question about when it's okay to neglect friction: in many textbook problems and exams, friction is neglected to simplify calculations. In real life, however, friction often plays a crucial role. When you're asked to neglect friction, it typically means they want you to focus on the core concepts at play, like the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration.

It's great to hear that you find numerical examples helpful. Let's try another one: if a 5 kg object is acted on by a 10 N force, using the formula F = ma, the acceleration would be 10 N / 5 kg = 2 m/s². This shows again that the more force applied, the greater the acceleration, and the more mass an object has, the lower its acceleration.
